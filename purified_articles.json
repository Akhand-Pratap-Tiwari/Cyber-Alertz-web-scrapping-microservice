As global organizations increasingly adopt cloud environments, security strategies have largely focused on \\\"shift-left\\\" practices\u2014securing code, ensuring proper cloud posture, and fixing misconfigurations. However, this approach has led to an over-reliance on a multitude of DR tools spanning cloud infrastructure, workloads, and even applications. Despite these advanced tools, organizations often take weeks or even months to identify and resolve incidents. \\n\\nAdd to this the challenges of tool sprawl, soaring cloud security costs, and overwhelming volumes of false positives, and it becomes clear that security teams are stretched thin. Many are forced to make hard decisions about which cloud breaches they can realistically defend against. \\nBy following these five targeted steps, security teams can greatly improve their real-time detection and response capabilities for cloud attacks.\\nStep 1: Add Runtime Visibility and Protection \\nWhen security teams lack real-time visibility, they're essentially operating blind, unable to respond effectively to threats. While cloud-native monitoring tools, container security solutions, and EDR systems offer valuable insights, they tend to focus on specific layers of the environment. A more comprehensive approach is achieved by using eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) sensors. eBPF enables deep, real-time observability across the entire stack\u2014network, infrastructure, workloads, and applications\u2014without disrupting production environments. By operating at the kernel level, it delivers visibility without adding performance overhead, making it a powerful solution for runtime security.\\nHere are some key capabilities to leverage for this step:\\n\\nTopology Graphs: Displays how hybrid or multi-cloud assets communicate and connect.\\nFull Asset Visibility: Showcases every asset in the environment, including clusters, networks, databases, secrets, and operating systems, all in one place.\\nExternal Connectivity Insights: Identifies connections to external entities, including details about the country of origin and DNS information.\\nRisk Assessments: Evaluate the risk level of each asset, alongside its impact on the business.\\n\\n\\nStep 2: Use a multi-layered detection strategy \\nAs attackers continue to evolve and evade detection, it becomes harder to find and stop breaches before they unfold. The biggest challenge in doing so lies in detecting cloud attack attempts where adversaries are stealth and exploit multiple attack surfaces\u2014 from network exploitation to data injection within a managed service \u2014 all while evading detection by cloud detection and response (CDR), cloud workload detection and response (CWPP/EDR), and application detection and response (ADR) solutions. This fragmented strategy has proven inadequate, allowing attackers to exploit gaps between layers to go unnoticed.\\nMonitoring cloud, workloads and application layers in a single platform provides the widest coverage and protection. It makes it possible to correlate application activity with infrastructure changes in real-time, ensuring attacks no longer slip through the cracks. \\nHere are some key capabilities to leverage for this step:\\n\\nFull-Stack Detection: Detects incidents from multiple sources across the cloud, applications, workloads, networks, and APIs. \\nAnomaly Detection: Utilizes machine learning and behavioral analysis to identify deviations from normal activity patterns that may indicate a threat.\\nDetects Known and Unknown Threats: Pinpoints events according to signatures, IoCs, TTPs, and MITRE known tactics.\\nIncident Correlation: Correlates security events and alerts across different sources to identify patterns and potential threats.\\n\\n\\nGet started with multi-layered detection and response today.\\nStep 3: View vulnerabilities in the same pane as your incidents \\nWhen vulnerabilities are isolated from incident data, the potential for delayed responses and oversight increases. This is because security teams end up lacking the context they need to understand how vulnerabilities are being exploited or the urgency of patching them in relation to ongoing incidents.\\nIn addition, when detection and response efforts leverage runtime monitoring (as explained above), vulnerability management becomes much more effective, focusing on active and critical risks to reduce noise by more than 90%.\\nHere are some key capabilities to leverage for this step:\\n\\nRisk Prioritization - Evaluates vulnerabilities according to critical criteria\u2014such as whether they are loaded into the applications memory, are executed, public-facing, exploitable, or fixable\u2014to focus on threats that actually matter.\\nRoot Cause Discovery - Finds the root cause for each vulnerability (in as deep as the image layer) in order to tackle the root as soon as possible and fix multiple vulnerabilities at once.\\nValidation of Fixes - Leverages ad-hoc scanning of images before they are deployed to ensure all vulnerabilities were addressed.\\nRegulation Adherence - Lists out all active vulnerabilities as an SBOM to adhere to compliance and regional regulations.\\n\\nStep 4: Incorporate identities to understand the \\\"who\\\", \\\"when\\\", and \\\"how\\\"\\nThreat actors often leverage compromised credentials to execute their attacks, engaging in credential theft, account takeovers, and more. This allows them to masquerade as legitimate users within the environment and go unnoticed for hours or even days. The key is to be able to detect this impersonation and the most effective way to do so is by establishing a baseline for each identity, human or otherwise. Once the typical access pattern of an identity is understood, detecting unusual behavior is easy. \\n\\nHere are some key capabilities to leverage for this step:\\n\\nBaseline Monitoring: Implements monitoring tools that capture and analyze baseline behavior for both users and applications. These tools should track access patterns, resource usage, and interaction with data.\\nHuman Identities Security: Integrates with identity providers for visibility into human identity usage, including login times, locations, devices, and behaviors, enabling quick detection of unusual or unauthorized access attempts.\\nNon-Human Identities Security: Tracks the usage of non-human identities, providing insights into their interactions with cloud resources and highlighting any anomalies that could signal a security threat.\\nSecrets Security: Identifies every secret across your cloud environment, tracks how it's used at runtime, and highlights whether they're securely managed or at risk of exposure.\\n\\nStep 5: Have a multitude of response actions available for contextual intervention\\nEach breach attempt has its own unique challenges to overcome, which is why it's essential to have a flexible response strategy that adapts to the specific situation. For example, an attacker might deploy a malicious process that requires immediate termination, while a different cloud event might involve a compromised workload that needs to be quarantined to prevent further damage. Once an incident is detected, security teams also need the context in order to investigate fast, such as comprehensive attack stories, damage assessments, and response playbooks. \\nHere are some key capabilities to leverage for this step:\\n\\nPlaybooks: Provide play-by-play responses for every incident detected to confidently intervene and terminate the threat.\\nTailored Attack Intervention: Offers the ability to isolate compromised workloads, block unauthorized network traffic, or terminate malicious processes.\\nRoot Cause Analysis: Determines the underlying cause of the incident to prevent recurrence. This involves analyzing the attack vector, vulnerabilities exploited, and weaknesses in defenses.\\nIntegration with SIEM: Integrates with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to enhance threat detection with contextual data.\\n\\nBy implementing these five steps, security teams can boost their detection and response capabilities and effectively stop cloud breaches in real-time with complete precision.

Checkmarx found that the effectiveness of command-jacking can be improved by a more stealthy tactic called command wrapping, which involves creating an entry point that acts as a wrapper around the original command, instead of replacing it altogether.\\n\\nWhat makes the approach potent is that it silently executes the malicious code while also invoking the original, legitimate command and returning the results of the execution, thus allowing it to fly under the radar.\\n\\\"Since the legitimate command still runs and its output and behavior are preserved, there's no immediate sign of compromise, making the attack extremely difficult to detect through normal use,\\\" the researchers said. \\\"This stealthy approach allows attackers to maintain long-term access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information without raising suspicion.\\\"\\nAnother entry point attack tactic entails creating malicious plugins and extensions for developer tools that have the capability to gain broad access to the codebase itself, thus giving bad actors an opportunity to change program behavior or tamper with the testing process to make it seem like the code is working as intended.\\n\\n\\\"Moving forward, it's crucial to develop comprehensive security measures that account for entry point exploitation,\\\" the researchers said. \\\"By understanding and addressing these risks, we can work towards a more secure Python packaging environment, safeguarding both individual developers and enterprise systems against sophisticated supply chain attacks.\\\"\\nThe development comes as Sonatype, in its annual State of the Software Supply Chain report, revealed that over 512,847 malicious packages have been discovered across open-source ecosystems for Java, JavaScript, Python, and .NET since November 2023, a 156% jump year-over-year.\\n\\\"Traditional security tools often fail to detect these novel attacks, leaving developers and automated build environments highly vulnerable,\\\" the company said. \\\"This has resulted in a new wave of next-generation supply chain attacks, which target developers directly, bypassing existing defenses.\\\"\", \"headline\": \"Supply Chain Attacks Can Exploit Entry Points in Python, npm, and Open-Source Ecosystems\", \"summary\": \"Researchers found that entry points in Python, npm, and other open-source ecosystems can be abused for software supply chain attacks.

While there are currently no details on the attacks, users are advised to update to Firefox 131.0.2, Firefox ESR 128.3.1, and Firefox ESR 115.16.1. Contagious Interview Remains Lucrative for N. Korea: Ever since details about a North Korean hacking campaign called Contagious Interview came to light nearly a year ago, it has continued to target the technology sector with no signs of stopping anytime soon. These attacks aim to deliver backdoors and information-stealing malware by deceiving developers into executing malicious code under the pretext of a coding assignment as part of a job interview after approaching them on platforms like LinkedIn. OpenAI Disrupts Malicious Operations: OpenAI said it has disrupted over 20 malicious cyber operations since the start of the year that abused its generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, ChatGPT, for debugging and developing malware, spreading misinformation, evading detection, and vulnerability research. One of the activity clusters was observed targeting OpenAI employees via spear-phishing attacks to deploy the SugarGh0st RAT. FBI Creates Fake Crypto to Disrupt Fraudulent Operation: The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) took the \\\"unprecedented step\\\" of creating its own cryptocurrency token and a company called NexFundAI to take down a fraud operation that allegedly manipulated digital asset markets by orchestrating an illegal scheme known as wash trading. A total of 18 people and entities have been charged in connection with the pump-and-dump scam, with three arrests reported so far. Gorilla Botnet Launches 300,000 DDoS Attacks Across 100 Countries: A botnet malware family called Gorilla issued over 300,000 attack commands in the month of September 2024 alone, targeting universities, government websites, telecoms, banks, gaming, and gambling sectors.

Register for this crucial webinar to gain the upper hand. Ask the Expert Q: With mobile devices increasingly targeted by cybercriminals, how can individuals protect their devices from network-based attacks, especially in unfamiliar or high-risk environments, such as when traveling? A: When you're traveling, your mobile device can be a target for attacks like rogue base stations\u2014fake cell towers set up to steal data or track your location. To protect yourself, start by enabling Lockdown Mode on iPhones, which blocks vulnerable 2G connections. Always use a VPN to keep your internet traffic encrypted and avoid using public Wi-Fi without it. A great tool to boost your awareness is the CellGuard app for iOS. It scans your network for suspicious activity, like rogue base stations, by analyzing things like signal strength and network anomalies. While it may flag some false alarms, it gives you an extra layer of protection. Cybersecurity Tools Broken Hill: A New Tool to Test AI Models' Weaknesses - It is an advanced tool that makes it easy to trick large AI models into misbehaving by bypassing their restrictions. It uses the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack to craft clever prompts that push popular models, like Llama-2 and Microsoft's Phi, to respond in ways they normally wouldn't. The best part? You can run it on consumer GPUs, like the Nvidia RTX 4090, without needing costly cloud servers. Ideal for researchers and security testers, Broken Hill helps uncover and fix vulnerabilities in AI models, making it a must-have tool in the fight against AI threats. Tip of the Week Your Browser Extensions Are Spying on You: Browser extensions can be useful but also risky, with potential access to your data or hidden malware.

Cybersecurity vendor Sophos said it has been tracking a series of attacks in the past month leveraging compromised VPN credentials and CVE-2024-40711 to create a local account and deploy the ransomware. CVE-2024-40711, rated 9.8 out of 10.0 on the CVSS scale, refers to a critical vulnerability that allows for unauthenticated remote code execution. It was addressed by Veeam in Backup & Replication version 12.2 in early September 2024. Security researcher Florian Hauser of Germany-based CODE WHITE has been credited with discovering and reporting security shortcomings. \\\"In each of the cases, attackers initially accessed targets using compromised VPN gateways without multifactor authentication enabled,\\\" Sophos said. \\\"Some of these VPNs were running unsupported software versions.\\\" \\\"Each time, the attackers exploited VEEAM on the URI /trigger on port 8000, triggering the Veeam.Backup.MountService.exe to spawn net.exe.

These malicious GitHub links can be associated with any repository that allows comments.\\\" Central to the attack chain is the abuse of GitHub infrastructure for staging the malicious payloads. One variation of the technique, first disclosed by OALABS Research in March 2024, involves threat actors opening a GitHub issue on well-known repositories and uploading to it a malicious payload, and then closing the issue without saving it. In doing so, it has been found that the uploaded malware persists even though the issue is never saved, a vector that has become ripe for abuse as it allows attackers to upload any file of their choice and not leave any trace except for the link to the file itself. The approach has been weaponized to trick users into downloading a Lua-based malware loader that is capable of establishing persistence on infected systems and delivering additional payloads, as detailed by Morphisec this week. The phishing campaign detected by Cofense employs a similar tactic, the only difference being that it utilizes GitHub comments to attach a file (i.e., the malware), after which the comment is deleted. Like in the aforementioned case, the link remains active and is propagated via phishing emails. \\\"Emails with links to GitHub are effective at bypassing SEG security because GitHub is typically a trusted domain,\\\" Malimban said. \\\"GitHub links allow threat actors to directly link to the malware archive in the email without having to use Google redirects, QR codes, or other SEG bypass techniques.\\\" The development comes as Barracuda Networks revealed novel methods adopted by phishers, including ASCII- and Unicode-based QR codes and blob URLs as a way to make it harder to block malicious content and evade detection. \\\"A blob URI (also known as a blob URL or an object URL) is used by browsers to represent binary data or file-like objects (called blobs) that are temporarily held in the browser's memory,\\\" security researcher Ashitosh Deshnur said. \\\"Blob URIs allow web developers to work with binary data like images, videos, or files directly within the browser, without having to send or retrieve it from an external server.\\\" It also follows new research from ESET that the threat actors behind the Telekopye Telegram toolkit have expanded their focus beyond online marketplace scams to target accommodation booking platforms such as Booking.com and Airbnb, with a sharp uptick detected in July 2024. The attacks are characterized by the use of compromised accounts of legitimate hotels and accommodation providers to contact potential targets, claiming purported issues with the booking payment and tricking them into clicking on a bogus link that prompts them to enter their financial information. \\\"Using their access to these accounts, scammers single out users who recently booked a stay and haven't paid yet \u2013 or paid very recently \u2013 and contact them via in-platform chat,\\\" researchers Jakub Sou\u010dek and Radek Jizba said. \\\"Depending on the platform and the Mammoth's settings, this leads to the Mammoth receiving an email or SMS from the booking platform.\\\" \\\"This makes the scam much harder to spot, as the information provided is personally relevant to the victims, arrives via the expected communication channel, and the linked, fake websites look as expected.\\\" What's more, the diversification of the victimology footprint has been complemented by improvements to the toolkit that allow the scammer groups to speed up the scam process using automated phishing page generation, improve communication with targets via interactive chatbots, protecting phishing websites against disruption by competitors, and other goals. Telekopye's operations have not been without their fair share of hiccups. In December 2023, law enforcement officials from Czechia and Ukraine announced the arrest of several cybercriminals who are alleged to have used the malicious Telegram bot. \\\"Programmers created, updated, maintained, and improved the functioning of Telegram bots and phishing tools, as well as ensuring the anonymity of accomplices on the internet and providing advice on concealing criminal activity,\\\" the Police of the Czech Republic said in a statement at the time. \\\"The groups in question were managed, from dedicated workspaces, by middle-aged men from Eastern Europe and West and Central Asia,\\\" ESET said. \\\"They recruited people in difficult life situations, through job portal postings promising 'easy money,' as well as by targeting technically skilled foreign students at universities.\\\"\", \"headline\": \"GitHub, Telegram Bots, and ASCII QR Codes Abused in New Wave of Phishing Attacks\", \"summary\": \"A new tax-themed malware campaign is using GitHub links to deliver Remcos RAT.

Hybrid password attacks merge multiple cracking techniques to amplify their effectiveness. These combined approaches exploit the strengths of various methods, accelerating the password-cracking process. \\nIn this post, we'll explore hybrid attacks \u2014 what they are and the most common types. We'll also discuss how your organization can defend against them.\\nThe blended approach of hybrid attacks\\nThreat actors are always looking for better, more successful ways to crack passwords \u2014 and hybrid attacks allow them to combine two different hacking techniques into a single attack. By integrating attack methodologies, they can take advantage of the strengths associated with each method, increasing their chances of success.\\nAnd hybrid attacks aren't just limited to cracking passwords. Cybercriminals regularly combine technical cyberattacks with other tactics, like social engineering. By approaching the target from multiple angles, hackers create a complex threat situation that is more difficult to defend against. \\nCommon types of password attacks\\nIn a hybrid password attack, hackers typically combine two distinct techniques: brute force and dictionary attacks. By combining the rapid iteration of a brute force attack with a list of the most commonly used passwords, hackers can quickly try numerous credential combinations. \\nBrute force attack\\nThink of a brute force attack like a hacker taking a battering ram to your organization's front door, striking it repeatedly until they gain entry. In these persistent, blatant attacks, cybercriminals use software to repeatedly attempt all possible character combinations until they land on the correct decryption key or password. A brute force attack is especially effective in situations where a user's password is shorter or less complex \u2014 and attackers use common base terms found in dictionary lists to give themself a head start. \\nDictionary attack\\nRemembering passwords can be a pain, which is why many of us reuse the same password across different sites or rely on simple password creation standards (e.g., start with a capital letter and end with a number) to make it easier. But hackers take advantage of this, using dictionary attacks, to speed up the process of guessing passwords. \\nIn a dictionary attack, the cybercriminal uses a list of likely password possibilities \u2014 including frequently used passwords (Password123), common phrases (iloveyou), or keyboard walks (ASDFG) to boost their odds. \\nMask attack\\nOne specific type of brute force attack is a mask attack, where the hacker knows an organization's password construction requirements and can target its guesses to passwords that fulfill those requirements. For example, the hacker may know that an organization requires user passwords to start with a capital letter, contain eight characters, and end with a number, allowing them to set up their attack parameters better. The reality is that if a hacker has any sort of information about a password's makeup, their hybrid attack can happen that much more quickly. \\nDefending against hybrid password attacks\\nHybrid password attacks work so well because they use multiple techniques to simultaneously target weaknesses in a business' password policy. To create a strong defense against hybrid attacks, your organization must develop strategies designed to eliminate weak or compromised passwords and then create stronger password policies that will help you stay secure in the future. Hackers are taking a multi-layered approach to their attacks, and your organization should similarly layer its security defenses. Specific strategies include:\\nImplement multi-factor authentication (MFA)\\nOne of the best ways to slow down (or prevent) a hack is multi-factor authentication, which requires users to authenticate themselves with more than just a password. With MFA, you may be able to stop a hacker from gaining access even if they successfully crack the password. While no strategy (including MFA) can guarantee 100% security, implementing MFA is an important step in your password security strategy. \\nRequire longer passwords\\nHackers love easy targets \u2014 and the longer the password is, the longer it takes for hackers to perform brute force attacks. The reality is that at a certain length, it becomes computationally inconvenient for hackers to successfully perform brute force attacks. Recommend users create 20-character or more passphrases \u2014 for example, by combining three random words like \\\"shoes-doorknob-caterpillar.\\\" Doing so can effectively mitigate the risk of a brute-force attack. \\nPrevent weak passwords and password patterns\\nAs we discussed, many hackers count on passwords containing commonly used words or patterns to make their hacking faster and easier. So, it stands to reason that if you can prevent users from using those words or patterns, you'll be taking strides to keep your organization safe. \\nAudit for compromised passwords\\nKeeping users from creating weak passwords via a strong password policy is a great strategy, but one that can be overcome if passwords are compromised during a phishing attack or breach. That's why it's so important also to take advantage of tools that can scan your Active Directory for compromised passwords. \\nFor example, Specops Password Auditor is a free, read-only tool that identifies compromised Active Directory passwords. By scanning your users' passwords against an ever-updating list of more than 1 billion unique password combinations, you can quickly ascertain which accounts are at risk and take immediate action to secure them. Download for free here.\\nA stronger password policy to defend against hybrid threats\\nHybrid threats take advantage of multiple attack methods \u2014 and defending against them requires a multi-layered approach. Consider using a tool like Specops Password Policy to strengthen your password policy requirements, continuously scan for and block over 4 billion known compromised passwords and will guide users toward creating strong passwords or passphrases. \\nImplementing a Specops password policy can significantly bolster your defense against hybrid security attacks. Here's why:\\nLayered Defense: Hybrid attacks often combine multiple tactics, like phishing and brute force. A robust password policy adds an extra layer of defense, making it harder for attackers to succeed even if they've gained some initial access.\\nLength: Encourage the use of longer passwords even in the form of passphrases. This makes passwords much harder to crack, even with sophisticated brute force tools often used in hybrid attacks.\\nBreached Password Protection: You can scan and prevent the use of passwords that have been exposed in previous data breaches and malware attacks. This is crucial because attackers often use credential-stuffing techniques with leaked passwords in hybrid attacks.\\nCompliance: Many industries have regulations that require strong password policies. Using Specops Password Policy you can help ensure you're compliant, potentially saving you from fines and reputational damage.\\nThe stronger your users' passwords are, the less likely they are to fall victim to hybrid attacks. With Specops' tools, you can take a hybrid approach to security, ensuring your data and systems stay secure. \\nReady to boost your security against hybrid threats?

The vulnerabilities impact multiple versions of Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Platform. One of the most critical flaws, tracked as CVE-2024-45733, affects Splunk Enterprise for Windows versions below 9.2.3 and 9.1.6. This vulnerability allows a low-privileged user without admin or power roles to perform remote code execution due to insecure session storage configuration. Splunk has rated this vulnerability as High severity with a CVSS score of 8.8. Another high-severity vulnerability, CVE-2024-45731, impacts Splunk Enterprise for Windows versions below 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6. It enables a low-privileged user to write files to the Windows system root directory when Splunk is installed on a separate drive. This could potentially allow the writing of malicious DLLs that, if loaded, could result in remote code execution. Analyse Any Suspicious Files With ANY.RUN: Intergarte With You Security Team  -> Try for Free A third vulnerability, CVE-2024-45732, affects multiple versions of Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Platform. It allows low-privileged users to run searches as the \u201cnobody\u201d user in the SplunkDeploymentServerConfig app, potentially accessing restricted data. Splunk has released patches to address these vulnerabilities and recommends users upgrade to the latest versions immediately. For Splunk Enterprise, users should upgrade to versions 9.3.1, 9.2.3, 9.1.6 or higher depending on their current version. Splunk Cloud Platform instances are being actively monitored and patched by the company. In addition to the remote code execution flaws, Splunk also patched several vulnerabilities in third-party packages used in the Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services. These include high-severity flaws in the idna and certifi packages. These vulnerabilities primarily impact instances when Splunk Web is enabled. Splunk has released patches to address these issues and strongly recommends users to upgrade to the latest versions:  Splunk Enterprise: 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6 or higher Splunk Cloud Platform: 9.2.2403.103, 9.1.2312.200, 9.1.2312.110, and 9.1.2308.208 or higher For users unable to update immediately, Splunk suggests several mitigations:  Disable Splunk Web on affected systems, especially on indexers in distributed environments. Modify the local.meta file in the SplunkDeploymentServerConfig app to restrict write access to knowledge objects. Ensure Splunk Enterprise is not installed on a separate disk from the system drive. Organizations using affected Splunk products are strongly advised to review the security advisories and apply the necessary updates as soon as possible to mitigate the risk of exploitation.  The discovery of these vulnerabilities highlights the importance of promptly applying security updates, especially for critical infrastructure and security monitoring tools like Splunk.

Hybrid password attacks merge multiple cracking techniques to amplify their effectiveness. These combined approaches exploit the strengths of various methods, accelerating the password-cracking process. \\nIn this post, we'll explore hybrid attacks \u2014 what they are and the most common types. We'll also discuss how your organization can defend against them.\\nThe blended approach of hybrid attacks\\nThreat actors are always looking for better, more successful ways to crack passwords \u2014 and hybrid attacks allow them to combine two different hacking techniques into a single attack. By integrating attack methodologies, they can take advantage of the strengths associated with each method, increasing their chances of success.\\nAnd hybrid attacks aren't just limited to cracking passwords. Cybercriminals regularly combine technical cyberattacks with other tactics, like social engineering. By approaching the target from multiple angles, hackers create a complex threat situation that is more difficult to defend against. \\nCommon types of password attacks\\nIn a hybrid password attack, hackers typically combine two distinct techniques: brute force and dictionary attacks. By combining the rapid iteration of a brute force attack with a list of the most commonly used passwords, hackers can quickly try numerous credential combinations. \\nBrute force attack\\nThink of a brute force attack like a hacker taking a battering ram to your organization's front door, striking it repeatedly until they gain entry. In these persistent, blatant attacks, cybercriminals use software to repeatedly attempt all possible character combinations until they land on the correct decryption key or password. A brute force attack is especially effective in situations where a user's password is shorter or less complex \u2014 and attackers use common base terms found in dictionary lists to give themself a head start. \\nDictionary attack\\nRemembering passwords can be a pain, which is why many of us reuse the same password across different sites or rely on simple password creation standards (e.g., start with a capital letter and end with a number) to make it easier. But hackers take advantage of this, using dictionary attacks, to speed up the process of guessing passwords. \\nIn a dictionary attack, the cybercriminal uses a list of likely password possibilities \u2014 including frequently used passwords (Password123), common phrases (iloveyou), or keyboard walks (ASDFG) to boost their odds. \\nMask attack\\nOne specific type of brute force attack is a mask attack, where the hacker knows an organization's password construction requirements and can target its guesses to passwords that fulfill those requirements. For example, the hacker may know that an organization requires user passwords to start with a capital letter, contain eight characters, and end with a number, allowing them to set up their attack parameters better. The reality is that if a hacker has any sort of information about a password's makeup, their hybrid attack can happen that much more quickly. \\nDefending against hybrid password attacks\\nHybrid password attacks work so well because they use multiple techniques to simultaneously target weaknesses in a business' password policy. To create a strong defense against hybrid attacks, your organization must develop strategies designed to eliminate weak or compromised passwords and then create stronger password policies that will help you stay secure in the future. Hackers are taking a multi-layered approach to their attacks, and your organization should similarly layer its security defenses. Specific strategies include:\\nImplement multi-factor authentication (MFA)\\nOne of the best ways to slow down (or prevent) a hack is multi-factor authentication, which requires users to authenticate themselves with more than just a password. With MFA, you may be able to stop a hacker from gaining access even if they successfully crack the password. While no strategy (including MFA) can guarantee 100% security, implementing MFA is an important step in your password security strategy. \\nRequire longer passwords\\nHackers love easy targets \u2014 and the longer the password is, the longer it takes for hackers to perform brute force attacks. The reality is that at a certain length, it becomes computationally inconvenient for hackers to successfully perform brute force attacks. Recommend users create 20-character or more passphrases \u2014 for example, by combining three random words like \\\"shoes-doorknob-caterpillar.\\\" Doing so can effectively mitigate the risk of a brute-force attack. \\nPrevent weak passwords and password patterns\\nAs we discussed, many hackers count on passwords containing commonly used words or patterns to make their hacking faster and easier. So, it stands to reason that if you can prevent users from using those words or patterns, you'll be taking strides to keep your organization safe. \\nAudit for compromised passwords\\nKeeping users from creating weak passwords via a strong password policy is a great strategy, but one that can be overcome if passwords are compromised during a phishing attack or breach. That's why it's so important also to take advantage of tools that can scan your Active Directory for compromised passwords. \\nFor example, Specops Password Auditor is a free, read-only tool that identifies compromised Active Directory passwords. By scanning your users' passwords against an ever-updating list of more than 1 billion unique password combinations, you can quickly ascertain which accounts are at risk and take immediate action to secure them. Download for free here.\\nA stronger password policy to defend against hybrid threats\\nHybrid threats take advantage of multiple attack methods \u2014 and defending against them requires a multi-layered approach. Consider using a tool like Specops Password Policy to strengthen your password policy requirements, continuously scan for and block over 4 billion known compromised passwords and will guide users toward creating strong passwords or passphrases. \\nImplementing a Specops password policy can significantly bolster your defense against hybrid security attacks. Here's why:\\nLayered Defense: Hybrid attacks often combine multiple tactics, like phishing and brute force. A robust password policy adds an extra layer of defense, making it harder for attackers to succeed even if they've gained some initial access.\\nLength: Encourage the use of longer passwords even in the form of passphrases. This makes passwords much harder to crack, even with sophisticated brute force tools often used in hybrid attacks.\\nBreached Password Protection: You can scan and prevent the use of passwords that have been exposed in previous data breaches and malware attacks. This is crucial because attackers often use credential-stuffing techniques with leaked passwords in hybrid attacks.\\nCompliance: Many industries have regulations that require strong password policies. Using Specops Password Policy you can help ensure you're compliant, potentially saving you from fines and reputational damage.\\nThe stronger your users' passwords are, the less likely they are to fall victim to hybrid attacks. With Specops' tools, you can take a hybrid approach to security, ensuring your data and systems stay secure. \\nReady to boost your security against hybrid threats?

Hybrid password attacks merge multiple cracking techniques to amplify their effectiveness. These combined approaches exploit the strengths of various methods, accelerating the password-cracking process. \\nIn this post, we'll explore hybrid attacks \u2014 what they are and the most common types. We'll also discuss how your organization can defend against them.\\nThe blended approach of hybrid attacks\\nThreat actors are always looking for better, more successful ways to crack passwords \u2014 and hybrid attacks allow them to combine two different hacking techniques into a single attack. By integrating attack methodologies, they can take advantage of the strengths associated with each method, increasing their chances of success.\\nAnd hybrid attacks aren't just limited to cracking passwords. Cybercriminals regularly combine technical cyberattacks with other tactics, like social engineering. By approaching the target from multiple angles, hackers create a complex threat situation that is more difficult to defend against. \\nCommon types of password attacks\\nIn a hybrid password attack, hackers typically combine two distinct techniques: brute force and dictionary attacks. By combining the rapid iteration of a brute force attack with a list of the most commonly used passwords, hackers can quickly try numerous credential combinations. \\nBrute force attack\\nThink of a brute force attack like a hacker taking a battering ram to your organization's front door, striking it repeatedly until they gain entry. In these persistent, blatant attacks, cybercriminals use software to repeatedly attempt all possible character combinations until they land on the correct decryption key or password. A brute force attack is especially effective in situations where a user's password is shorter or less complex \u2014 and attackers use common base terms found in dictionary lists to give themself a head start. \\nDictionary attack\\nRemembering passwords can be a pain, which is why many of us reuse the same password across different sites or rely on simple password creation standards (e.g., start with a capital letter and end with a number) to make it easier. But hackers take advantage of this, using dictionary attacks, to speed up the process of guessing passwords. \\nIn a dictionary attack, the cybercriminal uses a list of likely password possibilities \u2014 including frequently used passwords (Password123), common phrases (iloveyou), or keyboard walks (ASDFG) to boost their odds. \\nMask attack\\nOne specific type of brute force attack is a mask attack, where the hacker knows an organization's password construction requirements and can target its guesses to passwords that fulfill those requirements. For example, the hacker may know that an organization requires user passwords to start with a capital letter, contain eight characters, and end with a number, allowing them to set up their attack parameters better. The reality is that if a hacker has any sort of information about a password's makeup, their hybrid attack can happen that much more quickly. \\nDefending against hybrid password attacks\\nHybrid password attacks work so well because they use multiple techniques to simultaneously target weaknesses in a business' password policy. To create a strong defense against hybrid attacks, your organization must develop strategies designed to eliminate weak or compromised passwords and then create stronger password policies that will help you stay secure in the future. Hackers are taking a multi-layered approach to their attacks, and your organization should similarly layer its security defenses. Specific strategies include:\\nImplement multi-factor authentication (MFA)\\nOne of the best ways to slow down (or prevent) a hack is multi-factor authentication, which requires users to authenticate themselves with more than just a password. With MFA, you may be able to stop a hacker from gaining access even if they successfully crack the password. While no strategy (including MFA) can guarantee 100% security, implementing MFA is an important step in your password security strategy. \\nRequire longer passwords\\nHackers love easy targets \u2014 and the longer the password is, the longer it takes for hackers to perform brute force attacks. The reality is that at a certain length, it becomes computationally inconvenient for hackers to successfully perform brute force attacks. Recommend users create 20-character or more passphrases \u2014 for example, by combining three random words like \\\"shoes-doorknob-caterpillar.\\\" Doing so can effectively mitigate the risk of a brute-force attack. \\nPrevent weak passwords and password patterns\\nAs we discussed, many hackers count on passwords containing commonly used words or patterns to make their hacking faster and easier. So, it stands to reason that if you can prevent users from using those words or patterns, you'll be taking strides to keep your organization safe. \\nAudit for compromised passwords\\nKeeping users from creating weak passwords via a strong password policy is a great strategy, but one that can be overcome if passwords are compromised during a phishing attack or breach. That's why it's so important also to take advantage of tools that can scan your Active Directory for compromised passwords. \\nFor example, Specops Password Auditor is a free, read-only tool that identifies compromised Active Directory passwords. By scanning your users' passwords against an ever-updating list of more than 1 billion unique password combinations, you can quickly ascertain which accounts are at risk and take immediate action to secure them. Download for free here.\\nA stronger password policy to defend against hybrid threats\\nHybrid threats take advantage of multiple attack methods \u2014 and defending against them requires a multi-layered approach. Consider using a tool like Specops Password Policy to strengthen your password policy requirements, continuously scan for and block over 4 billion known compromised passwords and will guide users toward creating strong passwords or passphrases. \\nImplementing a Specops password policy can significantly bolster your defense against hybrid security attacks. Here's why:\\nLayered Defense: Hybrid attacks often combine multiple tactics, like phishing and brute force. A robust password policy adds an extra layer of defense, making it harder for attackers to succeed even if they've gained some initial access.\\nLength: Encourage the use of longer passwords even in the form of passphrases.

This attack vector poses significant risks to both individual developers and enterprises, highlighting the need for more comprehensive security measures in the open-source landscape. Entry points are designed to expose specific functionality as command-line interface (CLI) commands without requiring users to know the exact import path or structure of a package. However, attackers have found ways to leverage this feature for malicious purposes. According to Checkmarx the attack works by creating malicious packages that define entry points mimicking popular third-party tools or system commands. When unsuspecting developers install these packages and later execute the associated commands, they unknowingly trigger the execution of harmful code. Attackers employ various tactics to maximize the impact and stealth of their operations: Command-Jacking: Malicious packages impersonate widely-used third-party tools like \u2018aws\u2019, \u2018docker\u2019, or \u2018npm\u2019. When developers use these commands, the fake versions can potentially exfiltrate sensitive information or compromise entire cloud infrastructures. System Command Impersonation: Attackers create entry points that mimic fundamental system utilities such as \u2018touch\u2019, \u2018curl\u2019, or \u2018ls\u2019. The success of this method depends on the PATH order, with locally installed packages often taking precedence. Command Wrapping: To avoid detection, some attackers implement a wrapper around the original command. This technique executes the malicious code silently while still running the legitimate command, preserving normal behavior and making the attack extremely difficult to detect. The exploitation of entry points is not limited to the Python ecosystem but extends to other major ecosystems including npm (JavaScript), Ruby Gems, NuGet (.NET), Dart Pub, and Rust Crates. Checkmarx said this widespread vulnerability underscores the need for a comprehensive understanding of how entry points function across various programming languages and package managers. This new attack vector poses significant risks to both individual developers and enterprise systems. It has the potential to bypass traditional security checks and provide attackers with a stealthy, persistent method of compromising systems. To mitigate these risks, experts recommend: Implementing stricter vetting processes for third-party packages Regularly auditing installed packages and their entry points Using virtual environments to isolate potentially harmful packages Employing comprehensive security solutions that can detect suspicious entry points In light of these findings, developers and enterprises are urged to remain vigilant and take proactive steps to secure their open-source supply chains. This includes conducting thorough security audits of packages, using trusted sources for package installations, and staying informed about the latest security threats and best practices in the open-source community.\", \"headline\": \"New Supply Chain Attack Leveraging Entry Points in PyPI, npm, Ruby Gems & NuGet\", \"summary\": \"A new supply chain attack has been identified, targeting popular open-source package repositories like PyPI, npm, Ruby Gems, and NuGet.

This vulnerability tracked as CVE-2023-25581, allows for remote code execution (RCE), posing a significant risk to systems using the affected versions of pac4j-core. The vulnerability arises from a flaw in the deserialization process within the `InternalAttributeHandler` class of pac4j-core. This flaw allows attackers to exploit systems that store externally controlled values in attributes of the `UserProfile` class. By providing an attribute containing a serialized Java object prefixed with `{#sb64}` and Base64 encoded, attackers can trigger the deserialization of arbitrary Java classes. This is particularly dangerous as it can lead to RCE, allowing malicious actors to execute arbitrary code on the affected systems.

This vulnerability tracked as CVE-2023-25581, allows for remote code execution (RCE), posing a significant risk to systems using the affected versions of pac4j-core.The vulnerability arises from a flaw in the deserialization process within the `InternalAttributeHandler` class of pac4j-core. This flaw allows attackers to exploit systems that store externally controlled values in attributes of the `UserProfile` class. By providing an attribute containing a serialized Java object prefixed with `{#sb64}` and Base64 encoded, attackers can trigger the deserialization of arbitrary Java classes. This is particularly dangerous as it can lead to RCE, allowing malicious actors to execute arbitrary code on the affected systems.Analyse Any Suspicious Files With ANY.RUN: Intergarte With You Security Team\\n-> Try for FreeThe issue was discovered by Michael Stepankin from the GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) and reported to the pac4j development team on February 2, 2023. The team acknowledged the report and issued a fix on February 14, 2023, with the release of version 4.0 of pac4j-core.pac4j Vulnerable To RCE AttacksThe vulnerability is rooted in how the `restore` method within `InternalAttributeHandler` processes string attributes. The method fails to verify if a string value already begins with the `{#sb64}` prefix before attempting deserialization. This oversight can be exploited by manipulating attributes such as usernames or emails to include malicious serialized objects.Despite the presence of a `RestrictedObjectInputStream`, which imposes some limitations on deserialization, a wide range of Java packages remain vulnerable due to potentially exploitable gadget chains.The potential impact of this vulnerability is severe, as it could compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability by enabling RCE attacks. Users of pac4j-core are strongly advised to upgrade to version 4.0 or later, which addresses this security flaw. There are currently no known workarounds for this issue.The discovery and disclosure of this vulnerability underscore the importance of regular updates and vigilance in maintaining software security. As Java frameworks like pac4j are integral to many applications, ensuring they are secure is crucial for protecting against potential exploits.This vulnerability highlights the ongoing challenges in securing software frameworks against sophisticated attacks. The swift response by the pac4j team in addressing CVE-2023-25581 demonstrates a commitment to security and emphasizes the need for developers to remain proactive in applying updates and patches.For more detailed information on this vulnerability and its implications, users can refer to advisories published by security organizations and follow best practices for software maintenance.How to Choose an ultimate\\nManaged SIEM\\nsolution for Your Security Team -> Download Free Guide(PDF)\", \"headline\": \"Popular Java Framework pac4j Vulnerable To RCE Attacks\", \"summary\": \"A critical vulnerability has been identified in the Java security framework pac4j, specifically affecting versions prior to 4.0.

Because they\u2019re automated, they operate much faster than human users. The bot detection software helps to thwart these bots. Good bots perform helpful functions, similar to client service or indexing hunt machines; however, they can also be malware used to gain total control over a computer. Internet bots can also be called spiders, crawlers, or web bots. They perform malicious activities such as \u201ccontent scraping, credential & property theft, email address harvesting, click fraud, and others.\u201d What Can Bot Protection Software Do? Generally, bots have a predefined trigger that notifies them to start working, such as a particular keyword or an event like a message sent on social media.  Accordingly, bots work over a network and use internet-based services like instant messaging and interfaces like Twitterbots or Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  Bots are made from sets of algorithms that help them perform their tasks. The bot\u2019s processes must be rule-based and logical, with well-defined inputs and outputs. Is Bot A Spyware? Bot software can be used for both good and bad purposes. Lots of bots provide legitimate benefits to users, while others are designed to install spyware or steal sensitive data. A good bot can answer your questions quickly or give you relevant search results, whereas a bad one could perform spearphishing. Here are the best bot protection Tools to stop bad bots.

Dark web shop selling counterfeit documents (Source \u2013 Cato CTRL) Then it creates convincing deepfake videos that can pass dynamic facial recognition challenges requiring specific head movements.  These fake identities facilitate \u201cNAF,\u201d which caused \u201c$5.3 billion\u201d in losses in 2023 (more than from \u201c$3.9 billion\u201d in 2022).  The tool specifically targets \u201cmulti-factor authentication systems\u201d that combine something you have (\u201cID documents\u201d), something you know (\u201cpasswords\u201d), and something you are (\u201cbiometric verification\u201c).  The report reads that during the verification process, the ProKYC actors intercept and replace the genuine webcam input with pre-generated deep fake videos. This helped them to successfully bypass the security measures on platforms like \u201cByBit exchange,\u201d despite minor visual artifacts in the fake videos.  Not only that, but this automated approach also represents a significant evolution from traditional document forgery methods that enable the real-time creation of synthetic identities for large-scale \u201cmoney laundering\u201d operations and \u201cmule account\u201d creation. Digital forensics experts identify several indicative markers of manipulated content in deepfake detection like \u201cabnormally high-resolution quality in images\u201d (typically exceeding 4K) or \u201cvideos\u201d (60+ FPS), and \u201cinconsistencies in facial feature movements.\u201d To combat these evolving threats, organizations are implementing"}], "role": "model"}, "finish_reason": 2, "index": 0, "safety_ratings": [{"category": 9, "probability": 1, "blocked": false}, {"category": 8, "probability": 1, "blocked": false}, {"category": 7, "probability": 1, "blocked": false}, {"category": 10, "probability": 1, "blocked": false}], "citation_metadata": {"citation_sources": [{"start_index": 2875, "end_index": 3002, "uri": "https://help.erank.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-etsy-views-and-visits/", "license_": ""}, {"start_index": 2901, "end_index": 3039, "uri": "", "license_": ""}, {"start_index": 3355, "end_index": 3529, "uri": "https://cybersecuritynews.com/bot-protection-software/", "license_": ""}, {"start_index": 3566, "end_index": 3737, "uri": "https://cybersecuritynews.com/bot-protection-software/", "license_": ""}, {"start_index": 4240, "end_index": 4373, "uri": "https://cybersecuritynews.com/bot-protection-software/", "license_": ""}, {"start_index": 22060, "end_index": 22225, "uri": "https://cybersecuritynews.com/cybersecurity-risk-management-tools/", "license_": ""}]}, "token_count": 0, "grounding_attributions": [], "avg_logprobs": 0.0}], "usage_metadata": {"prompt_token_count": 18496, "candidates_token_count": 8192, "total_token_count": 26688, "cached_content_token_count": 0}}{"candidates": [{"content": {"parts": [{"text": "{\"list_of_news\": [{\"description\": \"The Apache Roller team revealed a critical security update addressing a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that could allow attackers to escalate privileges.\\nThis vulnerability, present in previous versions of Apache Roller, posed significant risks by potentially enabling unauthorized users to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users. \\n\\n\\nThe latest release, Apache Roller 6.1.4, introduces enhanced security measures to mitigate these threats.\\nKey Security Enhancements\\nThe Apache Roller 6.1.4 update brings several crucial security enhancements aimed at safeguarding user data and maintaining the integrity of web applications.\\nAnalyse Any Suspicious Links Using ANY.RUN\u2019s New Safe Browsing Tool:\\nOne of the most notable improvements is the implementation of safer defaults.

Many digital scams have traditionally relied on social engineering, or tricking victims into giving away their money willingly, rather than leaning on malware or other highly technical methods. But researchers have increasingly sounded the alarm that scammers are incorporating generative AI content and deepfakes to expand the scale and effectiveness of their operations. And the UN report offers the clearest evidence yet that these high tech tools are turning an already urgent situation into a crisis.\\nIn addition to buying written scripts to use with potential victims or relying on templates for malicious websites, attackers have increasingly been leaning on generative AI platforms to create communication content in multiple languages and deepfake generators that can create photos or even video of nonexistent people to show victims and enhance verisimilitude. Scammers have also been expanding their use of tools that can drain a victim\u2019s cryptocurrency wallets, have been manipulating transaction records to trick targets into sending cryptocurrency to the wrong places, and are compromising smart contracts to steal cryptocurrency. And in some cases, they\u2019ve been purchasing Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite internet systems to help power their efforts.\u201cAgile criminal networks are integrating these new technologies faster than anticipated, driven by new online marketplaces and service providers which have supercharged the illicit service economy,\u201d John Wojcik, a UNODC regional analyst, tells WIRED. \u201cThese developments have not only expanded the scope and efficiency of cyber-enabled fraud and cybercrime, but they have also lowered the barriers to entry for criminal networks that previously lacked the technical skills to exploit more sophisticated and profitable methods.\u201dFor years, China-linked criminals have trafficked people into gigantic compounds in Southeast Asia, where they are often forced to run scams, held against their will, and beaten if they refuse instructions. Around 200,000 people, from at least 60 countries, have been trafficked to compounds largely in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos over the last five years. However, as WIRED reporting has shown, these operations are spreading globally\u2014with scamming infrastructure emerging in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and West Africa.Most prominently, these organized crime operations have run pig butchering scams, where they build intimate relationships with victims before introducing an \u201cinvestment opportunity\u201d and asking for money. Criminal organizations may have conned people out of around $75 billion through pig butchering scams. Aside from pig butchering, according to the UN report, criminals across Southeast Asia are also running job scams, law enforcement impersonation, asset recovery scams, virtual kidnappings, sextortion, loan scams, business email compromise, and other illicit schemes. Criminal networks in the region earned up to $37 billion last year, UN officials estimate. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all of this revenue is allowing scammers to expand their operations and diversify, incorporating new infrastructure and technology into their systems in the hope of making them more efficient and brutally effective.For example, scammers are often constrained by their language skills and ability to keep up conversations with potentially hundreds of victims at a time in numerous languages and dialects. However, generative AI developments within the last two years\u2014including the launch of writing tools such as ChatGPT\u2014are making it easier for criminals to break down language barriers and create the content needed for scamming.\", \"headline\": \"Pig Butchering Scams Are Going High Tech\", \"summary\": \"Scammers in Southeast Asia are increasingly using AI, deepfakes, and dangerous malware to make their pig butchering operations even more convincing.

A largely different tool set created by the same threat group infected a European Union government organization three years later. Researchers from ESET, the security firm that discovered the toolkits, said some of the components in both were identical to those fellow security firm Kaspersky described in research published last year and attributed to an unknown group, tracked as GoldenJackal, working for a nation-state. Based on the overlap, ESET has concluded that the same group is behind all the attacks observed by both firms.Quite UnusualThe practice of air gapping is typically reserved for the most sensitive networks or devices connected to them, such as those used in systems for voting, industrial control, manufacturing, and power generation. A host of malware used in espionage hacking over the past 15 years (for instance, here and here) demonstrate that air gapping isn\u2019t a foolproof protection.

For example, scammers are often constrained by their language skills and ability to keep up conversations with potentially hundreds of victims at a time in numerous languages and dialects. However, generative AI developments within the last two years\u2014including the launch of writing tools such as ChatGPT\u2014are making it easier for criminals to break down language barriers and create the content needed for scamming. The UN\u2019s report says AI can be used for automating phishing attacks that ensnare victims, the creation of fake identities and online profiles, and the crafting of personalized scripts to trick victims while messaging them in different languages. \u201cThese developments have not only expanded the scope and efficiency of cyber-enabled fraud and cybercrime, but they have also lowered the barriers to entry for criminal networks that previously lacked the technical skills to exploit sophisticated and profitable methods,\u201d the report says. Stephanie Baroud, a criminal intelligence analyst in Interpol\u2019s human trafficking unit, says the impact of AI needs to be considered as part of a pig butchering scammer\u2019s tactics going forward. Baroud, who spoke with WIRED in an interview before the publication of the UN report, says the criminal\u2019s recruitment ads that lure people into being trafficked to scamming compounds used to be \u201cvery generic\u201d and full of grammatical errors. However, AI is now making them appear more polished and compelling, Baroud says. \u201cIt is really making it easier to create a very realistic job offer,\u201d she says. \u201cUnfortunately, this will make it much more difficult to identify which is the real and which is the fake ads.\u201d Perhaps the biggest AI paradigm shift in such digital attacks comes from deepfakes. Scammers are increasingly using machine-learning systems to allow for real-time face-swapping. This technology, which has also been used by romance scammers in West Africa, allows criminals to change their appearance on calls with their victims, making them realistically appear to be a different person. The technology is allowing \u201cone-click\u201d face swaps and high-resolution video feeds, the UN\u2019s report states. Such services are a game changer for scammers, because they allow attackers to \u201cprove\u201d to victims in photos or real-time video calls that they are who they claim to be. Using these setups, however, can require stable internet connections, which can be harder to maintain within some regions where pig butchering compounds and other scamming have flourished. There has been a \u201cnotable\u201d increase in cops seizing Starlink satellite dishes in recent months in Southeast Asia, the UN says\u201480 units were seized between April and June this year. In one such operation carried out in June, Thai police confiscated 58 Starlink devices. In another instance, law enforcement seized 10 Starlink devices and 4,998 preregistered SIM cards while criminals were in the process of moving their operations from Myanmar to Laos. Starlink did not immediately respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment. \u201cObviously using real people has been working for them very well, but using the tech could be cheaper after they have the required computers\u201d and connectivity, says Troy Gochenour, a volunteer with the Global Anti-Scam Organization (GASO), a US-based nonprofit that fights human-trafficking and cybercrime operations in Southeast Asia. Gochenour\u2019s research involves tracking trends on Chinese-language Telegram channels related to carrying out pig butchering scams. And he says that it is increasingly common to see people applying to be AI models for scam content. In addition to AI services, attackers have increasingly leaned on other technical solutions as well. One tool that has been increasingly common in digital scamming is so-called \u201ccrypto drainers,\u201d a type of malware that has particularly been deployed against victims in Southeast Asia. Drainers can be more or less technically sophisticated, but their common goal is to \u201cdrain\u201d funds from a target\u2019s cryptocurrency wallets and redirect the currency to wallets controlled by attackers. Rather than stealing the credentials to access the target wallet directly, drainers are typically designed to look like a legitimate service\u2014either by impersonating an actual platform or creating a plausible brand. Once a victim has been tricked into connecting their wallet to the drainer, they are then manipulated into approving one or a few transactions that grant attackers unintended access to all the funds in the wallet. Drainers can be used in many contexts and with many fronts. They can be a component of pig butchering investment scams, or promoted to potential victims through compromised social media accounts, phishing campaigns, and malvertizing. Researchers from the firm ScamSniffer, for example, published findings in December about sponsored social media and search engine ads linked to malicious websites that contained a cryptocurrency drainer. The campaign, which ran from March to December 2023 reportedly stole about $59 million from more than 63,000 victims around the world. Far from the low-tech days of doing everything through social engineering by building a rapport with potential victims and crafting tricky emails and text messages, today\u2019s scammers are taking a hybrid approach to make their operations as efficient and lucrative as possible, UN researchers say. And even if they aren\u2019t developing sophisticated malware themselves in most cases, scammers are increasingly in the market to use these malicious tools, prompting malware authors to adapt or create hacking tools for scams like pig butchering. Researchers say that scammers have been seen using infostealers and even remote access trojans that essentially create a backdoor in a victim\u2019s system that can be utilized in other types of attacks. And scammers are also expanding their use of malicious smart contracts that appear to programmatically establish a certain agreed-upon transaction or set of transactions, but actually does much more. \u201cInfostealer logs and underground data markets have also been critical to ongoing market expansion, with access to unprecedented amounts of sensitive data serving as a major catalyst,\u201d Wojcik, from the UNODC, says. The changing tactics are significant as global law enforcement scrambles to deter digital scamming. But they are just one piece of the larger picture, which is increasingly urgent and bleak for forced laborers and victims of these crimes. \u201cIt is now increasingly clear that a potentially irreversible displacement and spillover has taken place in which organized crime are able to pick, choose, and move value and jurisdictions as needed, with the resulting situation rapidly outpacing the capacity of governments to contain it,\u201d UN officials wrote in the report. \u201cFailure to address this ecosystem will have consequences for Southeast Asia and other regions.\u201d\", \"headline\": \"Pig Butchering Scams Are Going High Tech\", \"summary\": \"Scammers in Southeast Asia are increasingly turning to AI, deepfakes, and dangerous malware in a way that makes their pig butchering operations even more convincing.

One of the custom tool collections was used starting in 2019 against a South Asian embassy in Belarus. A largely different tool set created by the same threat group infected a European Union government organization three years later. Researchers from ESET, the security firm that discovered the toolkits, said some of the components in both were identical to those fellow security firm Kaspersky described in research published last year and attributed to an unknown group, tracked as GoldenJackal, working for a nation-state. Based on the overlap, ESET has concluded that the same group is behind all the attacks observed by both firms. The practice of air gapping is typically reserved for the most sensitive networks or devices connected to them, such as those used in systems for voting, industrial control, manufacturing, and power generation. A host of malware used in espionage hacking over the past 15 years (for instance, here and here) demonstrate that air gapping isn\u2019t a foolproof protection. It nonetheless forces threat groups to expend significant resources that are likely obtainable only by nation-states with superior technical acumen and unlimited budgets. ESET\u2019s discovery puts GoldenJackal in a highly exclusive collection of threat groups. \u201cWith the level of sophistication required, it is quite unusual that in five years, GoldenJackal managed to build and deploy not one but two separate tool sets designed to compromise air-gapped systems,\u201d ESET researcher Mat\u00edas Porolli wrote in Tuesday\u2019s report. \u201cThis speaks to the resourcefulness of the group.\u201d The evolution of the kit from 2019 and the one from three years later underscores a growing sophistication by GoldenJackal developers. The first generation provided a full suite of capabilities, including: GoldenDealer, a component that delivers malicious executables to air-gapped systems over USB drives GoldenHowl, a backdoor that contains various modules for a mix of malicious capabilities GoldenRobo, a file collector and exfiltrator Within a few weeks of deploying the kit in 2019, ESET said, GoldenJackal started using other tools on the same compromised devices. The newer tools, which Kaspersky documented in its 2023 research, included: A backdoor tracked under the name JackalControl JackalSteal, a file collector and exfiltrator JackalWorm, used to propagate other JackalControl and other malicious components over USB drives GoldenJackal, ESET said, continued using these tools into January of this year. The basic flow of the attack is, first, infecting an internet-connected device through a means ESET and Kaspersky have been unable to determine. Next, the infected computer infects any external drives that get inserted. When the infected drive is plugged into an air-gapped system, it collects and stores data of interest. Last, when the drive is inserted into the internet-connected device, the data is transferred to an attacker-controlled server. In the 2022 attack on the European Union governmental organization, GoldenJackal began using a new custom toolkit. Written in multiple programming languages, including Go and Python, the newer version took a much more specialized approach. It assigned different tasks to different types of infected devices and marshaled a much larger array of modules, which could be mixed and matched based on the attacker objects for different infections. \u201cIn the observed attacks, GoldenJackal started to use a highly modular approach, using various components to perform different tasks,\u201d ESET\u2019s Porolli wrote. \u201cSome hosts were abused to exfiltrate files, others were used as local servers to receive and distribute staged files or configuration files, and others were deemed interesting for file collection, for espionage purposes.\u201d The figure below classifies some of the components specifically: GoldenUsbCopy, which monitors for the insertion of USB drives on air-gapped devices and, when found, copies them to an encrypted container that is stored on disk GoldenUsbGo, which appears to be an updated version of GoldenUSBCopy GoldenAce, a distribution tool for propagating other malicious executables and retrieving files stored on USB drives HTTP server, an HTTP server whose precise function isn\u2019t well understood\\n GoldenBlacklist, which downloads an encrypted archive from a local server, sifts through received email messages for those of interest, and puts them in an archive for some other component to exfiltrate GoldenPyBlacklist, a Python implementation of GoldenBlacklist GoldenMailer, which, when connected to an internet device, exfiltrates files of interest previously stolen from an air-gapped device. The exfiltration occurs by attaching them to emails sent to an attacker-controlled email address GoldenDrive, a separate exfiltration tool that, in contrast to GoldenMailer, uploads files of interest to Google Drive. The newly discovered toolkit is composed of many different building blocks, written in multiple languages and capabilities. The overall goal appears to be increased flexibility and resiliency in the event one module is detected by the target. \u201cTheir goal is to get hard to obtain data from air-gapped systems and stay under the radar as much as possible,\u201d Costin Raiu, a researcher who worked at Kaspersky at the time it was researching GoldenJackal, wrote in an interview. \u201cMultiple exfiltration mechanisms indicate a very flexible tool kit that can accommodate all sorts of situations. These many tools indicate it\u2019s a highly customizable framework where they deploy exactly what they need as opposed to a multi purpose malware that can do anything.\u201d Other new insights offered by the ESET research is GoldenJackal\u2019s interest in targets located in Europe. Kaspersky researchers detected the group targeting Middle Eastern countries. Based on the information that was available to Kaspersky, company researchers couldn\u2019t attribute GoldenJackal to any specific country. ESET has also been unable to definitively identify the country, but it did find one hint that the threat group may have a tie to Turla, a potent hacking group working on behalf of Russia\u2019s FSB intelligence agency. The tie comes in the form of command-and-control protocol in GoldenHowl referred to as transport_http. The same expression is found in malware known to originate with Turla. Raiu said the highly modular approach is also reminiscent of Red October, an elaborate espionage platform discovered in 2013 targeting hundreds of diplomatic, governmental, and scientific organizations in at least 39 countries, including the Russian Federation, Iran, and the United States. While much of Tuesday\u2019s report contains technical analysis that is likely to be too advanced for many people to understand, it provides important new information that furthers insights into malware designed to jump air gaps and the tactics, techniques, and procedures of those who use it. The report will also be useful to people responsible for safeguarding the types of organizations most frequently targeted by nation-state groups. \u201cI\u2019d say this is mostly interesting for security people working in embassies and government CERTs,\u201d Raiu said. \u201cThey need to check for these TTPs and keep an eye on them in the future. If you were previously a victim of Turla or Red October I\u2019d keep an eye on this.\u201d\", \"headline\": \"A Mysterious Hacking Group Has 2 New Tools to Steal Data From Air-Gapped Machines\", \"summary\": \"Researchers have uncovered two sophisticated tool sets that a nation-state hacking group\u2014possibly from Russia\u2014used to steal sensitive data stored on air-gapped devices.

He said it occurred in September and that the stolen trove contains 31 million unique email addresses along with usernames, bcrypt password hashes, and other system data.

He added that he will provide further updates through his X account. Kahle provided a public update on Wednesday evening in a post on X. \u201cWhat we know: DDOS attack\u2014fended off for now; defacement of our website via JS library; breach of usernames/email/salted-encrypted passwords. What we\u2019ve done: Disabled the JS library, scrubbing systems, upgrading security. Will share more as we know it.\u201d \u201cScrubbing systems\u201d refer to services that offer DDoS attack protection by filtering malicious junk traffic so it can't deluge and disrupt a website. The Internet Archive has faced aggressive DDoS attacks numerous times in the past, including in late May. As Kahle wrote on Wednesday: \u201cYesterday's DDoS attack on @internetarchive repeated today. We are working to bring http://archive.org back online.\u201d The hacktivist group known as BlackMeta claimed responsibility for this week's DDoS attacks and said it plans to carry out more against the Internet Archive. Still, the perpetrator of the data breach is not yet known. The Internet Archive has faced battles on many fronts in recent months. In addition to repeated DDoS attacks, the organization is also facing mounting legal challenges. It recently lost an appeal in Hachette v. Internet Archive, a lawsuit brought by book publishers, which argued that its digital lending library violated copyright law. Now it\u2019s facing an existential threat in the form of another copyright lawsuit, this one from music labels, which may result in damages upwards of $621 million if the court rules against the archive. HIBP's Hunt says that he first received the stolen Internet Archive data on September 30, reviewed it on October 5, and warned the organization about it on October 6. He says the group confirmed the breach to him the next day and that he planned to load the data into HIBP and notify its subscribers about the breach on Wednesday. \u201cThey get defaced and DDoS'd, right as the data is loading into HIBP,\u201d Hunt wrote. \u201cThe timing on the last point seems to be entirely coincidental.\u201d Hunt added, too, that while he encouraged the group to publicly disclose the data breach itself before the HIBP notifications went out, the extenuating circumstances may explain the delay. \u201cObviously I would have liked to see that disclosure much earlier, but understanding how under attack they are, I think everyone should cut them some slack,\u201d Hunt wrote. \u201cThey're a nonprofit doing great work and providing a service that so many of us rely heavily on.\u201d\", \"headline\": \"Internet Archive Breach Exposes 31 Million Users\", \"summary\": \"The Internet Archive has confirmed a data breach that exposed the data of 31 million users.

That unnamed individual typed out the long string of characters of a Bitcoin private key on Gambaryan\u2019s laptop, allowing Gambaryan to move 69,370 bitcoins from Individual X\u2019s bitcoin address to one controlled by the US government. Over the four years that it has taken the US government to establish legal ownership of that massive sum of bitcoins\u2014identified by the IRS as stolen proceeds of the Silk Road dark-web drug market\u2014its value has grown to a staggering $4.4 billion dollars. The money's forfeiture appears to have been part of a deal that kept Individual X out of prison, though the terms of that deal have never been publicly disclosed. Instead, in a bizarre twist of fate, it's Gambaryan, the IRS criminal investigator who traced and seized that record-breaking sum of cryptocurrency, who is sitting in a Nigerian jail as those billions finally end up in US coffers. On Wednesday, the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal to a lower court ruling that the US government can seize Individual X's nearly 70,000 bitcoins, which the person allegedly took from the Silk Road more than a decade ago by exploiting a security vulnerability in the market. That stolen drug money has since been claimed by various parties, most recently by a company called Battle Born Investments that sought to appeal the seizure ruling and claimed to have purchased the Silk Road bitcoins through a bankruptcy proceeding. Only now that this appeal has fizzled, four years after the stolen money was tracked down in an investigation led by Gambaryan at IRS Criminal Investigations, can the US government finally take official possession of the wayward bitcoins, which will likely be auctioned off for dollars by the US Marshals Service, as smaller sums of seized cryptocurrency have in the past. \u201cThe Supreme Court's decision not to hear the case means that this is now is going to be forfeited to the United States government,\u201d says Will Frentzen, one of the US prosecutors who handled the Individual X case and is now an attorney at the legal firm Morrison Foerster. \u201cThis is the largest ever forfeiture of crypto that will go to the US Treasury.\u201d In fact, thanks to Bitcoin's wild appreciation in recent years, it appears to be the largest ever criminal seizure of money of any kind to be added to the US federal budget. (A seizure following the theft of 120,000 bitcoins from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex was even larger but will likely be repaid to victims and creditors rather than kept by the government.) Over those same years, however, Gambaryan has taken an even more unlikely path: In 2021, he left the IRS to take a job as the head of investigations at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange\u2014a move seen widely as driven by Binance\u2019s belated attempt to clean up its own widespread use for money laundering, which led the company to pay a $4.3 billion criminal fine to the US government last year. When Nigeria followed that fine by accusing Binance of similar criminal misconduct and devaluing the country's national currency, it was Gambaryan who was invited to Abuja to negotiate with the Nigerian government earlier this year. Instead, the Nigerian government detained Gambaryan, took his passport, and has now jailed him for over six months, charging him with money laundering and tax evasion as a proxy for his employer. \u201cIt's beyond bizarre. It's Twilight Zone every day,\u201d says Frentzen, who now has taken on Gambaryan's case in Nigeria as one of his defense attorneys. \u201cHis impact as a federal agent was so extensive and so far reaching that he's been out of the government for three years and yet the American government and the American public are still benefiting from his hard work. And he's languishing in a Nigerian jail cell on trumped-up charges. It's really unfathomable.\u201d Attention to Gambaryan's case has grown in recent months as lawmakers and US officials have increasingly appealed to the Nigerian government to release him on bail or on medical grounds. Gambaryan has suffered from a worsening herniated disc in his back that requires immediate surgery to prevent permanent injury, according to Frentzen. Yet he's been denied medical care in jail, and a video of him entering a courtroom in Abuja with a crutch seems to show a security guard refusing to help Gambaryan walk or to provide him with a wheelchair despite his pleas. In June, 16 members of Congress called in an open letter for Gambaryan's case to be treated as a hostage situation, and a resolution introduced in the House Foreign Affairs Committee in July urged the White House to apply pressure to Nigeria to free Gambaryan. \u201cI urge the State Department and I urge President Biden: Turn up the heat on Nigeria,\u201d Arkansas representative French Hill, who visited Gambaryan in jail, said in a hearing last month. \u201cHonor the fact that an American citizen has been snatched by a friendly government and put in prison over something he had no responsibility for.\u201d Over his 10 years at IRS Criminal Investigations, Gambaryan pioneered federal law enforcement's use of cryptocurrency tracing as an investigative technique, with landmark results: From 2014 to 2017, Gambaryan identified two corrupt federal agents who had enriched themselves with cryptocurrency during their investigation of the Silk Road; helped to track down half a billion dollars worth of bitcoins stolen from early crypto exchange Mt. Gox; had a hand in developing a secret crypto tracing method that located the server hosting the massive AlphaBay dark-web crime market; and helped to take down the Welcome to Video crypto-funded child sexual abuse video network, a case that led to 337 arrests around the world and the rescue of 23 children from exploitative situations. In the wake of that string of cases, Gambaryan and another IRS Criminal Investigations agent, Jeremy Haynie, began in 2017 to trace the 69,370 bitcoins that appeared to have been stolen from the Silk Road in 2012 and 2013 and had sat almost entirely unmoved in the years since. With the help of blockchain analysis and data from seized servers of the criminal BTC-e crypto exchange\u2014the fruits of another of Gambaryan's investigations\u2014the agents were able to identify Individual X as a hacker who had taken the Silk Road's funds and demand that they forfeit them. As those funds flow into the federal government's accounts, Frentzen hopes that federal officials who have the power to pressure Nigeria to free Gambaryan will remember where that record sum of money came from. \u201cIt should be a crystal-clear reminder of the impact that he's had for the American government and for the American people. To have him locked up while the US Treasury is collecting $4.4 billion because of his work, it's really twisted,\u201d Frentzen says. \u201cWe urge the US government to continue to work to secure his release and to do so as fast as possible. And we encourage the Nigerians to do the right thing and release him.\u201d\", \"headline\": \"69,000 Bitcoins Are Headed for the US Treasury\u2014While the Agent Who Seized Them Is in Jail\", \"summary\": \"The US Supreme Court has ruled that the US government can seize nearly 70,000 bitcoins stolen from the Silk Road, valued at $4.4 billion.

The backlash was immediate, with critics seeing the move as a disaster and admission of failure. Soon after the announcement, an article in Digiday described how Google execs were now \u201cin full-on damage control mode, trying to soothe everyone\u2019s nerves, both publicly and behind the scenes.\u201d Meanwhile, digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called the move \u201cbad for your privacy and good for Google's business.\u201d \u201cBy abandoning this plan, Google leaves billions of Chrome users vulnerable to online surveillance,\u201d the EFF\u2019s Lena Cohen wrote. Other browsers including Apple\u2019s Safari have already eradicated third-party cookies that track people across the web and target them with adverts amid concerns about privacy. But as the world\u2019s biggest browser with more than 65 percent share, Chrome\u2019s decision to phase out cookies was set to be the final nail in the coffin for the intrusive trackers. The news, therefore, came as a shock to all sides. So why has Google undergone such a seemingly large U-turn on third-party cookies, how will Chrome include the online trackers going forward, and how will that impact your privacy? Google first announced it would be phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome in 2020. But the company has postponed the move several times after multiple attempts to find an alternative\u2014including the ill-fated FLoC. While it seems like a backtrack, Google argues its new approach offers control over privacy settings while continuing to support third-party cookies for those who want them. Google said in a blog post that it will allow people to \u201cmake an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, with the option to adjust that choice at any time.\u201d As this moves forward, it remains \u201cimportant for developers to have privacy-enhancing alternatives,\u201d a Google spokesperson told WIRED in an emailed statement. Sources familiar with the matter say Google\u2019s new plan will be similar to Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature. Introduced in 2021, ATT stipulates that advertisers must ask explicit permission before accessing a user\u2019s mobile advertising ID, the identifier for advertisers (IDFA), for tracking. This means people must click on a pop-up to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to tracking when using Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system. Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox APIs, designed to reduce reliance on third-party cookies, will still be available. The firm also intends to offer additional privacy controls and is planning to introduce IP Protection into Chrome's Incognito mode. In response to criticism, Google tells WIRED that \u201celevating user choice\u201d for third-party cookies \u201cis good for privacy.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s Privacy Sandbox reflects years of feedback and engagement from privacy advocates, users, regulators, and others across the industry,\u201d Google spokesperson Scott Westover says. \u201cAs this moves forward, we\u2019ll continue to collaborate with the industry to build toward the next era of online privacy together.\u201d Google might say it\u2019s keeping third-party cookies, but experts argue that the tracking technology is dead either way. This means advertisers are already having to find other ways to monetize users. \u201cWe should have an expectation that the value and utility of third-party cookies has essentially gone to zero,\u201d says Nick Gernert, CEO of WordPress VIP. \u201cAnyone making plans that leverage data from third-party cookies may have diminishing returns in the long run.\u201d The apparent death of cookies also won\u2019t matter much to Google, which has a ton of data from multiple services in addition to Chrome and can target people without cookies. According to Google's 2023 earnings report, $237.86 billion of the firm\u2019s $307.39 billion in revenue came from ads. Ads on its search engine results page and other products including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play are the highest earner at a collective $175.03 billion, or 56.9 percent of overall revenue. YouTube ads bring in $31.51 billion (10.3 percent of the total), and Google Network ads including ads on Google\u2019s partner sites come in at $31.31 billion, 10.2 percent of revenue. Network ad revenues were down by 4.5 percent last year, showing Google reliance on this area is reducing. Google knows it\u2019s quite possible privacy-conscious users will opt out of Chrome cookies, just as they did with Apple\u2019s ATT, which saw Facebook taking a $10 billion hit. Now, ATT opt-in rates range from 12 percent to 40 percent across different app categories. The mobile advertising industry has boomed over recent years, even with Apple\u2019s ATT in place, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security outfit ESET. He calls the results of ATT \u201cimpressive\u201d and suggests Google has been watching the outcome of Apple\u2019s rules before implementing its own version. Meanwhile, Google is already advising developers to act as if they don\u2019t have cookies. The tech giant is working under the assumption that even if 80 percent do opt out, 20 percent of Chrome\u2019s more than 3 billion users isn\u2019t a bad result. Ensuring users have a conscious choice over whether they use cookies or not is \u201ca good step in practice,\u201d says Simon Bain, CEO at data and analytics platform OmniIndex. But Google needs to consider how easy it is to opt out, he says. \u201cAnd is there a negative impact on opting out for users?\u201d Bain says. \u201cThese are crucial because if opting out is buried in the privacy settings and there is a reduction in functionality or workflow as a result of not having them, then it is not really a fair or legitimate choice.\u201d Google says its updated approach allows people to \u201cmake an informed choice that applies across their web browsing,\u201d and says you\u2019ll be able to \u201cadjust that choice at any time.\u201d The plan is for this to be as usable as possible. Sources familiar with the matter confirmed Google\u2019s current plan would be a prominent global prompt, meaning users would not be asked to make choices on a site-by-site basis. Yet some experts question Google\u2019s motives. Sean Wright, an independent security researcher, points out that Google has \u201can enormous amount of data on individuals,\u201d which gives a lot of power to \u201ca single entity.\u201d This level of control could put user privacy at risk, Wright says. \u201cMy concern is that you have a large company that is already well established, developing its own ecosystem with little competition. There seems little incentive to enhance the privacy of users.\u201d But Google argues that it has received feedback from \u201ca wide variety of stakeholders,\u201d including regulators such as the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, publishers, web developers and standards groups, civil society, and participants in the advertising industry. \u201cThis has helped us craft solutions that aim to support a competitive and thriving marketplace that works for publishers and advertisers, and encourage the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies,\u201d the company says. Even so, privacy is a difficult balance to strike for the world\u2019s biggest browser whose business model is designed to rely on advertising. This is already well known, and if you care about your privacy, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ve already ditched Chrome for another browser. If you haven\u2019t, Chrome alternatives include Apple\u2019s Safari, Brave, Vivaldi, Firefox, and the DuckDuckGo browser. Brave and Vivaldi and based on the same Chromium engine as Chrome, so they include some of the same functionality.\", \"headline\": \"What Google\u2019s U-Turn on Third-Party Cookies Means for Chrome Privacy\", \"summary\": \"Google has paused its plans to abolish third-party cookies in its Chrome browser.

He said it occurred in September and that the stolen trove contains 31 million unique email addresses along with usernames, bcrypt password hashes, and other system data. Bleeping Computer, which first reported the breach, also confirmed the validity of the data.\u201cHave you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach?\u201d the attackers wrote in Wednesday's Internet Archive pop-up message. \u201cIt just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!\u201dIn addition to the breach and site defacement, the Internet Archive has been grappling with a wave of distributed denial-of-service attacks that have intermittently brought down its services.\u201cThe Internet Archive' services have been taken offline to recover from ongoing intermittent DDoS attacks,\u201d Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle told WIRED on Thursday. He added that he will provide further updates through his X account.Kahle provided a public update on Wednesday evening in a post on X. \u201cWhat we know: DDOS attack\u2014fended off for now; defacement of our website via JS library; breach of usernames/email/salted-encrypted passwords. What we\u2019ve done: Disabled the JS library, scrubbing systems, upgrading security. Will share more as we know it.\u201d \u201cScrubbing systems\u201d refer to services that offer DDoS attack protection by filtering malicious junk traffic so it can't deluge and disrupt a website.The Internet Archive has faced aggressive DDoS attacks numerous times in the past, including in late May. As Kahle wrote on Wednesday: \u201cYesterday's DDoS attack on @internetarchive repeated today. We are working to bring http://archive.org back online.\u201d The hacktivist group known as BlackMeta claimed responsibility for this week's DDoS attacks and said it plans to carry out more against the Internet Archive. Still, the perpetrator of the data breach is not yet known.The Internet Archive has faced battles on many fronts in recent months. In addition to repeated DDoS attacks, the organization is also facing mounting legal challenges. It recently lost an appeal in Hachette v. Internet Archive, a lawsuit brought by book publishers, which argued that its digital lending library violated copyright law. Now it\u2019s facing an existential threat in the form of another copyright lawsuit, this one from music labels, which may result in damages upwards of $621 million if the court rules against the archive.HIBP's Hunt says that he first received the stolen Internet Archive data on September 30, reviewed it on October 5, and warned the organization about it on October 6. He says the group confirmed the breach to him the next day and that he planned to load the data into HIBP and notify its subscribers about the breach on Wednesday. \u201cThey get defaced and DDoS'd, right as the data is loading into HIBP,\u201d Hunt wrote. \u201cThe timing on the last point seems to be entirely coincidental.\u201dHunt added, too, that while he encouraged the group to publicly disclose the data breach itself before the HIBP notifications went out, the extenuating circumstances may explain the delay.\u201cObviously I would have liked to see that disclosure much earlier, but understanding how under attack they are, I think everyone should cut them some slack,\u201d Hunt wrote. \u201cThey're a nonprofit doing great work and providing a service that so many of us rely heavily on.\u201dUpdate 2:30 pm ET, October 10, 2024: Added comment from Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle.\", \"headline\": \"Internet Archive Breach Exposes 31 Million Users\", \"summary\": \"The Internet Archive, home to the Wayback Machine, has suffered a major data breach exposing data of 31 million users.

The money's forfeiture appears to have been part of a deal that kept Individual X out of prison, though the terms of that deal have never been publicly disclosed.Instead, in a bizarre twist of fate, it's Gambaryan, the IRS criminal investigator who traced and seized that record-breaking sum of cryptocurrency, who is sitting in a Nigerian jail as those billions finally end up in US coffers.On Wednesday, the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal to a lower court ruling that the US government can seize Individual X's nearly 70,000 bitcoins, which the person allegedly took from the Silk Road more than a decade ago by exploiting a security vulnerability in the market. That stolen drug money has since been claimed by various parties, most recently by a company called Battle Born Investments that sought to appeal the seizure ruling and claimed to have purchased the Silk Road bitcoins through a bankruptcy proceeding. Only now that this appeal has fizzled, four years after the stolen money was tracked down in an investigation led by Gambaryan at IRS Criminal Investigations, can the US government finally take official possession of the wayward bitcoins, which will likely be auctioned off for dollars by the US Marshals Service, as smaller sums of seized cryptocurrency have in the past.\u201cThe Supreme Court's decision not to hear the case means that this is now is going to be forfeited to the United States government,\u201d says Will Frentzen, one of the US prosecutors who handled the Individual X case and is now an attorney at the legal firm Morrison Foerster. \u201cThis is the largest ever forfeiture of crypto that will go to the US Treasury.\u201d In fact, thanks to Bitcoin's wild appreciation in recent years, it appears to be the largest ever criminal seizure of money of any kind to be added to the US federal budget. (A seizure following the theft of 120,000 bitcoins from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex was even larger but will likely be repaid to victims and creditors rather than kept by the government.)Over those same years, however, Gambaryan has taken an even more unlikely path: In 2021, he left the IRS to take a job as the head of investigations at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange\u2014a move seen widely as driven by Binance\u2019s belated attempt to clean up its own widespread use for money laundering, which led the company to pay a $4.3 billion criminal fine to the US government last year. When Nigeria followed that fine by accusing Binance of similar criminal misconduct and devaluing the country's national currency, it was Gambaryan who was invited to Abuja to negotiate with the Nigerian government earlier this year. Instead, the Nigerian government detained Gambaryan, took his passport, and has now jailed him for over six months, charging him with money laundering and tax evasion as a proxy for his employer.\", \"headline\": \"69,000 Bitcoins Are Headed for the US Treasury\u2014While the Agent Who Seized Them Is in Jail\", \"summary\": \"The US government is set to receive $4.4 billion in cryptocurrency, the largest-ever criminal forfeiture.

But as the world\u2019s biggest browser with more than 65 percent share, Chrome\u2019s decision to phase out cookies was set to be the final nail in the coffin for the intrusive trackers.The news, therefore, came as a shock to all sides. So why has Google undergone such a seemingly large U-turn on third-party cookies, how will Chrome include the online trackers going forward, and how will that impact your privacy?Don\u2019t Call It a BacktrackGoogle first announced it would be phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome in 2020. But the company has postponed the move several times after multiple attempts to find an alternative\u2014including the ill-fated FLoC.While it seems like a backtrack, Google argues its new approach offers control over privacy settings while continuing to support third-party cookies for those who want them. Google said in a blog post that it will allow people to \u201cmake an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, with the option to adjust that choice at any time.\u201dAs this moves forward, it remains \u201cimportant for developers to have privacy-enhancing alternatives,\u201d a Google spokesperson told WIRED in an emailed statement.Sources familiar with the matter say Google\u2019s new plan will be similar to Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature. Introduced in 2021, ATT stipulates that advertisers must ask explicit permission before accessing a user\u2019s mobile advertising ID, the identifier for advertisers (IDFA), for tracking. This means people must click on a pop-up to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to tracking when using Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system.Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox APIs, designed to reduce reliance on third-party cookies, will still be available. The firm also intends to offer additional privacy controls and is planning to introduce\\nIP Protection\\ninto Chrome's Incognito mode.In response to criticism, Google tells WIRED that \u201celevating user choice\u201d for third-party cookies \u201cis good for privacy.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s Privacy Sandbox reflects years of feedback and engagement from privacy advocates, users, regulators, and others across the industry,\u201d Google spokesperson Scott Westover says. \u201cAs this moves forward, we\u2019ll continue to collaborate with the industry to build toward the next era of online privacy together.\u201dCookies, CrumbledGoogle might say it\u2019s keeping third-party cookies, but experts argue that the tracking technology is dead either way. This means advertisers are already having to find other ways to monetize users.\u201cWe should have an expectation that the value and utility of third-party cookies has essentially gone to zero,\u201d says Nick Gernert, CEO of WordPress VIP. \u201cAnyone making plans that leverage data from third-party cookies may have diminishing returns in the long run.\u201dThe apparent death of cookies also won\u2019t matter much to Google, which has a ton of data from multiple services in addition to Chrome and can target people without cookies.According to\\nGoogle's 2023 earnings report, $237.86 billion of the firm\u2019s $307.39 billion in revenue came from ads. Ads on its\\nsearch engine results page\\nand other products including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play are the highest earner at a collective $175.03 billion, or 56.9 percent of overall revenue. YouTube ads bring in $31.51 billion (10.3 percent of the total), and Google Network ads including ads on Google\u2019s partner sites come in at $31.31 billion, 10.2 percent of revenue. Network ad revenues were down by 4.5 percent last year, showing Google reliance on this area is reducing.Google knows it\u2019s quite possible privacy-conscious users will opt out of Chrome cookies, just as they did with Apple\u2019s ATT, which saw Facebook taking a $10 billion hit. Now, ATT opt-in rates range from 12 percent to 40 percent across different app categories.The mobile advertising industry has boomed over recent years, even with Apple\u2019s ATT in place, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security outfit ESET. He calls the results of ATT \u201cimpressive\u201d and suggests Google has been watching the outcome of Apple\u2019s rules before implementing its own version.Meanwhile, Google is already advising developers to act as if they don\u2019t have cookies. The tech giant is working under the assumption that even if 80 percent do opt out, 20 percent of Chrome\u2019s more than 3 billion users isn\u2019t a bad result.Ensuring users have a conscious choice over whether they use cookies or not is \u201ca good step in practice,\u201d says Simon Bain, CEO at data and analytics platform OmniIndex. But Google needs to consider how easy it is to opt out, he says.\u201cAnd is there a negative impact on opting out for users?\u201d Bain says. \u201cThese are crucial because if opting out is buried in the privacy settings and there is a reduction in functionality or workflow as a result of not having them, then it is not really a fair or legitimate choice.\u201dInformed ChoiceGoogle says its updated approach allows people to \u201cmake an informed choice that applies across their web browsing,\u201d and says you\u2019ll be able to \u201cadjust that choice at any time.\u201dThe plan is for this to be as usable as possible. Sources familiar with the matter confirmed Google\u2019s current plan would\\nbe\\na prominent global prompt, meaning users would not be asked to make choices on a site-by-site basis.Yet some experts question Google\u2019s motives. Sean Wright, an independent security researcher, points out that Google has \u201can enormous amount of data on individuals,\u201d which gives a lot of power to \u201ca single entity.\u201dThis level of control could put user privacy at risk, Wright says. \u201cMy concern is that you have a large company that is already well established, developing its own ecosystem with little competition. There seems little incentive to enhance the privacy of users.\u201dBut Google argues that it has received feedback from \u201ca wide variety of stakeholders,\u201d including regulators such as the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, publishers, web developers and standards groups, civil society, and participants in the advertising industry. \u201cThis has helped us craft solutions that aim to support a competitive and thriving marketplace that works for publishers and advertisers, and encourage the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies,\u201d the company says.Even so, privacy is a difficult balance to strike for the world\u2019s biggest browser whose business model is designed to rely on advertising.This is already well known, and if you care about your privacy, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ve already ditched Chrome for another browser. If you haven\u2019t, Chrome alternatives include Apple\u2019s Safari, Brave, Vivaldi, Firefox, and the DuckDuckGo browser. Brave and Vivaldi and based on the same Chromium engine as Chrome, so they include some of the same functionality.\", \"headline\": \"What Google's U-Turn on Third-Party Cookies Means for Chrome Privacy\", \"summary\": \"Google has reversed its plan to abolish third-party cookies in Chrome, opting for a more nuanced approach.

That phone is one of three that the bureau has taken from Adams, but agents seized Adams' personal phone a day later than the other two devices he used in an official capacity. By that time, Adams had not only changed the passcode on the phone from a four digit PIN to six digits\u2014a measure he says he took to prevent staffers from intentionally or unintentionally deleting information from the device. He also claims he immediately \u201cforgot\u201d that code to unlock it.That very convenient amnesia may leave the FBI and prosecutors in a situation similar to their investigation into the San Bernardino mass shooting carried out by Syed Rizwan Farook in 2016, when the US government demanded Apple help unlock the shooter's encrypted iPhone, leading to a high-profile standoff between the Apple and the FBI. In that case, the cybersecurity firm Azimuth eventually used a closely guarded\u2014and expensive\u2014hacking technique to unlock the device. In Adams' case, prosecutors hinted that the FBI may have to resort to similar measures. \u201cDecryption always catches up with encryption,\u201d a prosecutor in the case, Hagan Scotten, told the judge.Harvard Students Add Face Recognition to Meta\u2019s Smart GlassesFace recognition is one of only a few technologies that even Facebook and Google have hesitated to integrate into products like Google Glass and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses\u2014and rightly so, given the privacy implications of a device that would allow anyone to look at a stranger on the street and immediately determine their phone number and home address. Now, however, a group of Harvard students has shown how easy it is to bolt that face recognition onto Meta's augmented-reality eyewear. The project, known as I-XRAY, integrates with the face-recognition service Pimeyes to let Ray-Ban Meta wearers learn the name of virtually anyone they see and then immediately scour databases of personal information to determine other info about them, including names of family members, phone numbers, and home addresses. The students say they're not releasing the code for their experiment, instead intending it as a demonstration of the privacy-invasive potential of augmented-reality devices. Point made.Meta Says It Will Train Its AI on Input from Smart GlassesIf that warning about the privacy risks of AR eyewear needed more reinforcement, Meta this week also conceded to TechCrunch that it will use input from users' smart glasses to train its AI products. Initially, Meta declined to answer TechCrunch's questions about whether and how it would collect information from Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses for use as AI training data, in contrast to companies like OpenAI and Anthropic that explicitly say they don't exploit user inputs to train their AI services. A couple of days later, however, Meta confirmed to TechCrunch that it does in fact use images or video collected through its smart glasses to train its AI, but only if the user submits them to Meta's AI tools. That means anything that a user sees and asks Meta's AI chatbot to comment on or analyze will become part of Meta's massive AI-training data trove.Microsoft and the DOJ Seize 100+ Domains Used by Russian SpiesIf you can't arrest Russian hackers, at least you can nab their web domains. That, at least, is the approach this week of the US Justice Department, which along with Microsoft and the NGO Information Sharing and Analysis Center used a lawsuit to take control of more than a hundred web domains that had been used by Russian hackers working for the Kremlin's intelligence and law enforcement agency known as the FSB. Those domains had been exploited in phishing campaigns by the Russian hacker group known as Star Blizzard, which has a history of targeting the typical victims of geopolitical spying such as journalists, think tanks, and NGOs. The domain seizures seem designed in part to head off threats of foreign interference in next month's US election. \u201cRebuilding infrastructure takes time, absorbs resources, and costs money,\u201d Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel of Microsoft\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit, said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s action impacts [the hackers'] operations at a critical point in time when foreign interference in US democratic processes is of utmost concern.\u201d\", \"headline\": \"Security News This Week: The FBI Still Hasn\u2019t Cracked NYC Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 Phone\", \"summary\": \"The FBI is still struggling to access the phone of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a key piece of evidence in the corruption case against him.

One image, which does not contain a vehicle or a license plate, shows a bright red \u201cTrump\u201d campaign sign placed in front of someone\u2019s garage. In the background is a banner referencing Israel, a holly wreath, and a festive inflatable snowman.Another image taken on a different day by a different vehicle shows a \u201cSteelworkers for Harris-Walz\u201d sign stuck in the lawn in front of someone\u2019s home. A construction worker, with his face unblurred, is pictured near another Harris sign. Other photos show Trump and Biden (including \u201cFuck Biden\u201d) bumper stickers on the back of trucks and cars across America. One photo, taken in November 2023, shows a partially torn bumper sticker supporting the Obama-Biden lineup.These images were generated by AI-powered cameras mounted on cars and trucks, initially designed to capture license plates, but which are now photographing political lawn signs outside private homes, individuals wearing T-shirts with text, and vehicles displaying pro-abortion bumper stickers\u2014all while recording the precise locations of these observations. Newly obtained data reviewed by WIRED shows how a tool originally intended for traffic enforcement has evolved into a system capable of monitoring speech protected by the US Constitution.The detailed photographs all surfaced in search results produced by the systems of DRN Data, a license-plate-recognition (LPR) company owned by Motorola Solutions. The LPR system can be used by private investigators, repossession agents, and insurance companies; a related Motorola business, called Vigilant, gives cops access to the same LPR data.However, files shared with WIRED by artist Julia Weist, who is documenting restricted datasets as part of her work, show how those with access to the LPR system can search for common phrases or names, such as those of politicians, and be served with photographs where the search term is present, even if it is not displayed on license plates.A search result for the license plates from Delaware vehicles with the text \u201cTrump\u201d returned more than 150 images showing people\u2019s homes and bumper stickers. Each search result includes the date, time, and exact location of where a photograph was taken.\u201cI searched for the word \u2018believe,\u2019 and that is all lawn signs. There\u2019s things just painted on planters on the side of the road, and then someone wearing a sweatshirt that says \u2018Believe.\u2019\u201d Weist says. \u201cI did a search for the word \u2018lost,\u2019 and it found the flyers that people put up for lost dogs and cats.\u201dBeyond highlighting the far-reaching nature of LPR technology, which has collected billions of images of license plates, the research also shows how people\u2019s personal political views and their homes can be recorded into vast databases that can be queried.\u201cIt really reveals the extent to which surveillance is happening on a mass scale in the quiet streets of America,\u201d says Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThat surveillance is not limited just to license plates, but also to a lot of other potentially very revealing information about people.\u201dDRN, in a statement issued to WIRED, said it complies with \u201call applicable laws and regulations.\u201dBillions of PhotosLicense-plate-recognition systems, broadly, work by first capturing an image of a vehicle; then they use optical character recognition (OCR) technology to identify and extract the text from the vehicle's license plate within the captured image. Motorola-owned DRN sells multiple license-plate-recognition cameras: a fixed camera that can be placed near roads, identify a vehicle\u2019s make and model, and capture images of vehicles traveling up to 150 mph; a \u201cquick deploy\u201d camera that can be attached to buildings and monitor vehicles at properties; and mobile cameras that can be placed on dashboards or be mounted to vehicles and capture images when they are driven around.Over more than a decade, DRN has amassed more than 15 billion \u201cvehicle sightings\u201d across the United States, and it claims in its marketing materials that it amasses more than 250 million sightings per month. Images in DRN\u2019s commercial database are shared with police using its Vigilant system, but images captured by law enforcement are not shared back into the wider database.The system is partly fueled by DRN \u201caffiliates\u201d who install cameras in their vehicles, such as repossession trucks, and capture license plates as they drive around. Each vehicle can have up to four cameras attached to it, capturing images in all angles. These affiliates earn monthly bonuses and can also receive free cameras and search credits.In 2022, Weist became a certified private investigator in New York State. In doing so, she unlocked the ability to access the vast array of surveillance software accessible to PIs. Weist could access DRN\u2019s analytics system, DRNsights, as part of a package through investigations company IRBsearch. (After Weist published an op-ed detailing her work, IRBsearch conducted an audit of her account and discontinued it. The company did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment.)\u201cThere is a difference between tools that are publicly accessible, like Google Street View, and things that are searchable,\u201d Weist says. While conducting her work, Weist ran multiple searches for words and popular terms, which found results far beyond license plates. In data she shared with WIRED, a search for \u201cPlanned Parenthood,\u201d for instance, returned stickers on cars, on bumpers, and in windows, both for and against the reproductive health services organization. Civil liberties groups have already raised concerns about how license-plate-reader data could be weaponized against those seeking abortion.Weist says she is concerned with how the search tools could be misused when there is increasing political violence and divisiveness in society. While not linked to license plate data, one law enforcement official in Ohio recently said people should \u201cwrite down\u201d the addresses of people who display yard signs supporting Vice President Kamala Harris, the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, exemplifying how a searchable database of citizens\u2019 political affiliations could be abused.A 2016 report by the Associated Press revealed widespread misuse of confidential law enforcement databases by police officers nationwide. In 2022, WIRED revealed that hundreds of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees and contractors were investigated for abusing similar databases, including LPR systems. The alleged misconduct in both reports ranged from stalking and harassment to sharing information with criminals.While people place signs in their lawns or bumper stickers on their cars to inform people of their views and potentially to influence those around them, the ACLU\u2019s Stanley says it is intended for \u201chuman-scale visibility,\u201d not that of machines. \u201cPerhaps they want to express themselves in their communities, to their neighbors, but they don't necessarily want to be logged into a nationwide database that\u2019s accessible to police authorities,\u201d Stanley says.Weist says the system, at the very least, should be able to filter out images that do not contain license plate data and not make mistakes. \u201cAny number of times is too many times, especially when it's finding stuff like what people are wearing or lawn signs,\u201d Weist says.\u201cLicense plate recognition (LPR) technology supports public safety and community services, from helping to find abducted children and stolen vehicles to automating toll collection and lowering insurance premiums by mitigating insurance fraud,\u201d Jeremiah Wheeler, the president of DRN, says in a statement.Weist believes that, given the relatively small number of images showing bumper stickers compared to the large number of vehicles with them, Motorola Solutions may be attempting to filter out images containing bumper stickers or other text.Wheeler did not respond to WIRED's questions about whether there are limits on what can be searched in license plate databases, why images of homes with lawn signs but no vehicles in sight appeared in search results, or if filters are used to reduce such images.\u201cDRNsights complies with all applicable laws and regulations,\u201d Wheeler says. \u201cThe DRNsights tool allows authorized parties to access license plate information and associated vehicle information that is captured in public locations and visible to all. Access is restricted to customers with certain permissible purposes under the law, and those in breach have their access revoked.\u201dAI EverywhereLicense-plate-recognition systems have flourished in recent years as cameras have become smaller and machine-learning algorithms have improved. These systems, such as DRN and rival Flock, mark part of a change in the way people are surveilled as they move around cities and neighborhoods.Increasingly, CCTV cameras are being equipped with AI to monitor people\u2019s movements and even detect their emotions. The systems have the potential to alert officials, who may not be able to constantly monitor CCTV footage, to real-world events. However, whether license plate recognition can reduce crime has been questioned.\u201cWhen government or private companies promote license plate readers, they make it sound like the technology is only looking for lawbreakers or people suspected of stealing a car or involved in an amber alert, but that\u2019s just not how the technology works,\u201d says Dave Maass, the director of investigations at civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cThe technology collects everyone's data and stores that data often for immense periods of time.\u201dOver time, the technology may become more capable, too. Maass, who has long researched license-plate-recognition systems, says companies are now trying to do \u201cvehicle fingerprinting,\u201d where they determine the make, model, and year of the vehicle based on its shape and also determine if there\u2019s damage to the vehicle. DRN\u2019s product pages say one upcoming update will allow insurance companies to see if a car is being used for ride-sharing.\u201cThe way that the country is set up was to protect citizens from government overreach, but there\u2019s not a lot put in place to protect us from private actors who are engaged in business meant to make money,\u201d Nicole McConlogue, an associate professor of law at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law, who has researched license-plate-surveillance systems and their potential for discrimination.\u201cThe volume that they\u2019re able to do this in is what makes it really troubling,\u201d McConlogue says of vehicles moving around streets collecting images. \u201cWhen you do that, you're carrying the incentives of the people that are collecting the data. But also, in the United States, you\u2019re carrying with it the legacy of segregation and redlining, because that left a mark on the composition of neighborhoods.\u201d\", \"headline\": \"License Plate Readers Are Creating a US-Wide Database of More Than Just Cars\", \"summary\": \"License plate readers are capturing more than just license plates.

That unnamed individual typed out the long string of characters of a Bitcoin private key on Gambaryan\u2019s laptop, allowing Gambaryan to move 69,370 bitcoins from Individual X\u2019s bitcoin address to one controlled by the US government.Over the four years that it has taken the US government to establish legal ownership of that massive sum of bitcoins\u2014identified by the IRS as stolen proceeds of the Silk Road dark-web drug market\u2014its value has grown to a staggering $4.4 billion dollars. The money's forfeiture appears to have been part of a deal that kept Individual X out of prison, though the terms of that deal have never been publicly disclosed.Instead, in a bizarre twist of fate, it's Gambaryan, the IRS criminal investigator who traced and seized that record-breaking sum of cryptocurrency, who is sitting in a Nigerian jail as those billions finally end up in US coffers.On Wednesday, the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal to a lower court ruling that the US government can seize Individual X's nearly 70,000 bitcoins, which the person allegedly took from the Silk Road more than a decade ago by exploiting a security vulnerability in the market. That stolen drug money has since been claimed by various parties, most recently by a company called Battle Born Investments that sought to appeal the seizure ruling and claimed to have purchased the Silk Road bitcoins through a bankruptcy proceeding. Only now that this appeal has fizzled, four years after the stolen money was tracked down in an investigation led by Gambaryan at IRS Criminal Investigations, can the US government finally take official possession of the wayward bitcoins, which will likely be auctioned off for dollars by the US Marshals Service, as smaller sums of seized cryptocurrency have in the past.\u201cThe Supreme Court's decision not to hear the case means that this is now is going to be forfeited to the United States government,\u201d says Will Frentzen, one of the US prosecutors who handled the Individual X case and is now an attorney at the legal firm Morrison Foerster. \u201cThis is the largest ever forfeiture of crypto that will go to the US Treasury.\u201d In fact, thanks to Bitcoin's wild appreciation in recent years, it appears to be the largest ever criminal seizure of money of any kind to be added to the US federal budget. (A seizure following the theft of 120,000 bitcoins from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex was even larger but will likely be repaid to victims and creditors rather than kept by the government.)Over those same years, however, Gambaryan has taken an even more unlikely path: In 2021, he left the IRS to take a job as the head of investigations at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange\u2014a move seen widely as driven by Binance\u2019s belated attempt to clean up its own widespread use for money laundering, which led the company to pay a $4.3 billion criminal fine to the US government last year. When Nigeria followed that fine by accusing Binance of similar criminal misconduct and devaluing the country's national currency, it was Gambaryan who was invited to Abuja to negotiate with the Nigerian government earlier this year. Instead, the Nigerian government detained Gambaryan, took his passport, and has now jailed him for over six months, charging him with money laundering and tax evasion as a proxy for his employer.Most PopularSecurityThe War on Passwords Is One Step Closer to Being OverBy Lily Hay NewmanSciencePsychedelic Mushrooms Are Getting Much, Much StrongerBy Mattha BusbySecurityPig Butchering Scams Are Going High TechBy Matt BurgessCultureThe 25 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt Kamen\u201cIt's beyond bizarre. It's Twilight Zone every day,\u201d says Frentzen, who now has taken on Gambaryan's case in Nigeria as one of his defense attorneys. \u201cHis impact as a federal agent was so extensive and so far reaching that he's been out of the government for three years and yet the American government and the American public are still benefiting from his hard work. And he's languishing in a Nigerian jail cell on trumped-up charges. It's really unfathomable.\u201dAttention to Gambaryan's case has grown in recent months as lawmakers and US officials have increasingly appealed to the Nigerian government to release him on bail or on medical grounds. Gambaryan has suffered from a worsening herniated disc in his back that requires immediate surgery to prevent permanent injury, according to Frentzen. Yet he's been denied medical care in jail, and a video of him entering a courtroom in Abuja with a crutch seems to show a security guard refusing to help Gambaryan walk or to provide him with a wheelchair despite his pleas.In June, 16 members of Congress called in an open letter for Gambaryan's case to be treated as a hostage situation, and a resolution introduced in the House Foreign Affairs Committee in July urged the White House to apply pressure to Nigeria to free Gambaryan. \u201cI urge the State Department and I urge President Biden: Turn up the heat on Nigeria,\u201d Arkansas representative French Hill, who visited Gambaryan in jail, said in a hearing last month. \u201cHonor the fact that an American citizen has been snatched by a friendly government and put in prison over something he had no responsibility for.\u201dOver his 10 years at IRS Criminal Investigations, Gambaryan pioneered federal law enforcement's use of cryptocurrency tracing as an investigative technique, with landmark results: From 2014 to 2017, Gambaryan identified two corrupt federal agents who had enriched themselves with cryptocurrency during their investigation of the Silk Road; helped to track down half a billion dollars worth of bitcoins stolen from early crypto exchange Mt. Gox; had a hand in developing a secret crypto tracing method that located the server hosting the massive AlphaBay dark-web crime market; and helped to take down the Welcome to Video crypto-funded child sexual abuse video network, a case that led to 337 arrests around the world and the rescue of 23 children from exploitative situations.Most PopularSecurityThe War on Passwords Is One Step Closer to Being OverBy Lily Hay NewmanSciencePsychedelic Mushrooms Are Getting Much, Much StrongerBy Mattha BusbySecurityPig Butchering Scams Are Going High TechBy Matt BurgessCultureThe 25 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenIn the wake of that string of cases, Gambaryan and another IRS Criminal Investigations agent, Jeremy Haynie, began in 2017 to trace the 69,370 bitcoins that appeared to have been stolen from the Silk Road in 2012 and 2013 and had sat almost entirely unmoved in the years since. With the help of blockchain analysis and data from seized servers of the criminal BTC-e crypto exchange\u2014the fruits of another of Gambaryan's investigations\u2014the agents were able to identify Individual X as a hacker who had taken the Silk Road's funds and demand that they forfeit them.As those funds flow into the federal government's accounts, Frentzen hopes that federal officials who have the power to pressure Nigeria to free Gambaryan will remember where that record sum of money came from. \u201cIt should be a crystal-clear reminder of the impact that he's had for the American government and for the American people. To have him locked up while the US Treasury is collecting $4.4 billion because of his work, it's really twisted,\u201d Frentzen says. \u201cWe urge the US government to continue to work to secure his release and to do so as fast as possible.

The backlash was immediate, with critics seeing the move as a disaster and admission of failure.Soon after the announcement, an article in Digiday described how Google execs were now \u201cin full-on damage control mode, trying to soothe everyone\u2019s nerves, both publicly and behind the scenes.\u201d Meanwhile, digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called the move \u201cbad for your privacy and good for Google's business.\u201d\u201cBy abandoning this plan, Google leaves billions of Chrome users vulnerable to online surveillance,\u201d the EFF\u2019s Lena Cohen wrote.Other browsers including Apple\u2019s Safari have already eradicated third-party cookies that track people across the web and target them with adverts amid concerns about privacy. But as the world\u2019s biggest browser with more than 65 percent share, Chrome\u2019s decision to phase out cookies was set to be the final nail in the coffin for the intrusive trackers.The news, therefore, came as a shock to all sides. So why has Google undergone such a seemingly large U-turn on third-party cookies, how will Chrome include the online trackers going forward, and how will that impact your privacy?Don\u2019t Call It a BacktrackGoogle first announced it would be phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome in 2020. But the company has postponed the move several times after multiple attempts to find an alternative\u2014including the ill-fated FLoC.While it seems like a backtrack, Google argues its new approach offers control over privacy settings while continuing to support third-party cookies for those who want them. Google said in a blog post that it will allow people to \u201cmake an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, with the option to adjust that choice at any time.\u201dAs this moves forward, it remains \u201cimportant for developers to have privacy-enhancing alternatives,\u201d a Google spokesperson told WIRED in an emailed statement.Sources familiar with the matter say Google\u2019s new plan will be similar to Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature. Introduced in 2021, ATT stipulates that advertisers must ask explicit permission before accessing a user\u2019s mobile advertising ID, the identifier for advertisers (IDFA), for tracking. This means people must click on a pop-up to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to tracking when using Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system.Most PopularSecurityThe War on Passwords Is One Step Closer to Being OverBy Lily Hay NewmanSciencePsychedelic Mushrooms Are Getting Much, Much StrongerBy Mattha BusbySecurityPig Butchering Scams Are Going High TechBy Matt BurgessGearOn\u2019s Spray-On Shoes Promise More Bounces for Less OuncesBy Boone AshworthGoogle\u2019s Privacy Sandbox APIs, designed to reduce reliance on third-party cookies, will still be available. The firm also intends to offer additional privacy controls and is planning to introduce\\nIP Protection\\ninto Chrome's Incognito mode.In response to criticism, Google tells WIRED that \u201celevating user choice\u201d for third-party cookies \u201cis good for privacy.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s Privacy Sandbox reflects years of feedback and engagement from privacy advocates, users, regulators, and others across the industry,\u201d Google spokesperson Scott Westover says. \u201cAs this moves forward, we\u2019ll continue to collaborate with the industry to build toward the next era of online privacy together.\u201dCookies, CrumbledGoogle might say it\u2019s keeping third-party cookies, but experts argue that the tracking technology is dead either way. This means advertisers are already having to find other ways to monetize users.\u201cWe should have an expectation that the value and utility of third-party cookies has essentially gone to zero,\u201d says Nick Gernert, CEO of WordPress VIP. \u201cAnyone making plans that leverage data from third-party cookies may have diminishing returns in the long run.\u201dThe apparent death of cookies also won\u2019t matter much to Google, which has a ton of data from multiple services in addition to Chrome and can target people without cookies.According to\\nGoogle's 2023 earnings report, $237.86 billion of the firm\u2019s $307.39 billion in revenue came from ads. Ads on its\\nsearch engine results page\\nand other products including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play are the highest earner at a collective $175.03 billion, or 56.9 percent of overall revenue. YouTube ads bring in $31.51 billion (10.3 percent of the total), and Google Network ads including ads on Google\u2019s partner sites come in at $31.31 billion, 10.2 percent of revenue. Network ad revenues were down by 4.5 percent last year, showing Google reliance on this area is reducing.Google knows it\u2019s quite possible privacy-conscious users will opt out of Chrome cookies, just as they did with Apple\u2019s ATT, which saw Facebook taking a $10 billion hit. Now, ATT opt-in rates range from 12 percent to 40 percent across different app categories.The mobile advertising industry has boomed over recent years, even with Apple\u2019s ATT in place, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security outfit ESET. He calls the results of ATT \u201cimpressive\u201d and suggests Google has been watching the outcome of Apple\u2019s rules before implementing its own version.Most PopularSecurityThe War on Passwords Is One Step Closer to Being OverBy Lily Hay NewmanSciencePsychedelic Mushrooms Are Getting Much, Much StrongerBy Mattha BusbySecurityPig Butchering Scams Are Going High TechBy Matt BurgessGearOn\u2019s Spray-On Shoes Promise More Bounces for Less OuncesBy Boone AshworthMeanwhile, Google is already advising developers to act as if they don\u2019t have cookies. The tech giant is working under the assumption that even if 80 percent do opt out, 20 percent of Chrome\u2019s more than 3 billion users isn\u2019t a bad result.Ensuring users have a conscious choice over whether they use cookies or not is \u201ca good step in practice,\u201d says Simon Bain, CEO at data and analytics platform OmniIndex. But Google needs to consider how easy it is to opt out, he says.\u201cAnd is there a negative impact on opting out for users?\u201d Bain says. \u201cThese are crucial because if opting out is buried in the privacy settings and there is a reduction in functionality or workflow as a result of not having them, then it is not really a fair or legitimate choice.\u201dInformed ChoiceGoogle says its updated approach allows people to \u201cmake an informed choice that applies across their web browsing,\u201d and says you\u2019ll be able to \u201cadjust that choice at any time.\u201dThe plan is for this to be as usable as possible. Sources familiar with the matter confirmed Google\u2019s current plan would\\nbe\\na prominent global prompt, meaning users would not be asked to make choices on a site-by-site basis.Yet some experts question Google\u2019s motives. Sean Wright, an independent security researcher, points out that Google has \u201can enormous amount of data on individuals,\u201d which gives a lot of power to \u201ca single entity.\u201dThis level of control could put user privacy at risk, Wright says. \u201cMy concern is that you have a large company that is already well established, developing its own ecosystem with little competition. There seems little incentive to enhance the privacy of users.\u201dBut Google argues that it has received feedback from \u201ca wide variety of stakeholders,\u201d including regulators such as the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, publishers, web developers and standards groups, civil society, and participants in the advertising industry. \u201cThis has helped us craft solutions that aim to support a competitive and thriving marketplace that works for publishers and advertisers, and encourage the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies,\u201d the company says.Even so, privacy is a difficult balance to strike for the world\u2019s biggest browser whose business model is designed to rely on advertising.This is already well known, and if you care about your privacy, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ve already ditched Chrome for another browser. If you haven\u2019t, Chrome alternatives include Apple\u2019s Safari, Brave, Vivaldi, Firefox, and the DuckDuckGo browser. Brave and Vivaldi and based on the same Chromium engine as Chrome, so they include some of the same functionality.You Might Also Like \u2026In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archiveElon Musk is a national security riskInterview: Meredith Whittaker is out to prove capitalism wrongHow do you solve a problem like Polestar?Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San FranciscoTopicsprivacyGoogleChromeBrowsersdataAdvertisingsurveillanceRead MoreThe War on Passwords Is One Step Closer to Being Over\u201cPasskeys,\u201d the secure authentication mechanism built to replace passwords, are getting more portable and easier for organizations to implement thanks to new initiatives the FIDO Alliance announced on Monday.Lily Hay NewmanPsychedelic Mushrooms Are Getting Much, Much StrongerCultivators are turning to genetic sequencing and cellular-manipulation techniques to breed highly potent mushrooms\u2014leaving some unprepared psychonauts in distress.Mattha BusbyPig Butchering Scams Are Going High TechScammers in Southeast Asia are increasingly turning to AI, deepfakes, and dangerous malware in a way that makes their pig butchering operations even more convincing.Matt BurgessSpaceX\u2019s Dramatic Rocket Catch Brings Interplanetary Travel One Step CloserBy proving that its Super Heavy booster can return to Earth and land, SpaceX has moved closer to creating a reusable interplanetary transport system.Marta MussoThe 25 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right NowThe Legend of Vox Machina, The Boys, and Fallout are just a few of the shows you should be watching on Amazon Prime Video this week.Matt KamenEurope\u2019s Innovation Ecosystem Can Make It the New Palo AltoA cluster of European cities within a five-hour train ride of London could become a unicorn factory to rival Silicon Valley, argues tech investor Saul Klein.Saul KleinThe Best Sunscreens for Every BodyWe spent all summer road-testing sunscreen, from mineral and chemical to tinted and spray versions.

That phone is one of three that the bureau has taken from Adams, but agents seized Adams' personal phone a day later than the other two devices he used in an official capacity. By that time, Adams had not only changed the passcode on the phone from a four digit PIN to six digits\u2014a measure he says he took to prevent staffers from intentionally or unintentionally deleting information from the device. He also claims he immediately \u201cforgot\u201d that code to unlock it.That very convenient amnesia may leave the FBI and prosecutors in a situation similar to their investigation into the San Bernardino mass shooting carried out by Syed Rizwan Farook in 2016, when the US government demanded Apple help unlock the shooter's encrypted iPhone, leading to a high-profile standoff between the Apple and the FBI. In that case, the cybersecurity firm Azimuth eventually used a closely guarded\u2014and expensive\u2014hacking technique to unlock the device. In Adams' case, prosecutors hinted that the FBI may have to resort to similar measures. \u201cDecryption always catches up with encryption,\u201d a prosecutor in the case, Hagan Scotten, told the judge.Harvard Students Add Face Recognition to Meta\u2019s Smart GlassesFace recognition is one of only a few technologies that even Facebook and Google have hesitated to integrate into products like Google Glass and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses\u2014and rightly so, given the privacy implications of a device that would allow anyone to look at a stranger on the street and immediately determine their phone number and home address. Now, however, a group of Harvard students has shown how easy it is to bolt that face recognition onto Meta's augmented-reality eyewear. The project, known as I-XRAY, integrates with the face-recognition service Pimeyes to let Ray-Ban Meta wearers learn the name of virtually anyone they see and then immediately scour databases of personal information to determine other info about them, including names of family members, phone numbers, and home addresses. The students say they're not releasing the code for their experiment, instead intending it as a demonstration of the privacy-invasive potential of augmented-reality devices. Point made.Meta Says It Will Train Its AI on Input from Smart GlassesIf that warning about the privacy risks of AR eyewear needed more reinforcement, Meta this week also conceded to TechCrunch that it will use input from users' smart glasses to train its AI products. Initially, Meta declined to answer TechCrunch's questions about whether and how it would collect information from Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses for use as AI training data, in contrast to companies like OpenAI and Anthropic that explicitly say they don't exploit user inputs to train their AI services. A couple of days later, however, Meta confirmed to TechCrunch that it does in fact use images or video collected through its smart glasses to train its AI, but only if the user submits them to Meta's AI tools. That means anything that a user sees and asks Meta's AI chatbot to comment on or analyze will become part of Meta's massive AI-training data trove.Microsoft and the DOJ Seize 100+ Domains Used by Russian SpiesIf you can't arrest Russian hackers, at least you can nab their web domains. That, at least, is the approach this week of the US Justice Department, which along with Microsoft and the NGO Information Sharing and Analysis Center used a lawsuit to take control of more than a hundred web domains that had been used by Russian hackers working for the Kremlin's intelligence and law enforcement agency known as the FSB. Those domains had been exploited in phishing campaigns by the Russian hacker group known as Star Blizzard, which has a history of targeting the typical victims of geopolitical spying such as journalists, think tanks, and NGOs. The domain seizures seem designed in part to head off threats of foreign interference in next month's US election. \u201cRebuilding infrastructure takes time, absorbs resources, and costs money,\u201d Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel of Microsoft\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit, said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s action impacts [the hackers'] operations at a critical point in time when foreign interference in US democratic processes is of utmost concern.\u201dMost PopularSecurityPig Butchering Scams Are Going High TechBy Matt BurgessSciencePsychedelic Mushrooms Are Getting Much, Much StrongerBy Mattha BusbyGearHigh-End Fashion Dupes Are Soaring Where Knock-Offs Never CouldBy Amy FrancombeCultureThe 25 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenYou Might Also Like \u2026In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archiveElon Musk is a national security riskInterview: Meredith Whittaker is out to prove capitalism wrongHow do you solve a problem like Polestar?Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San FranciscoAndy Greenberg is a senior writer for WIRED covering hacking, cybersecurity, and surveillance.

While privacy advocates called foul, the implications for users is not so clear cut. This summer, Google conspicuously paused its long-held plans to abolish third-party cookies in its Chrome browser after failing to please a mix of privacy campaigners, regulators, and advertisers. The backlash was immediate, with critics seeing the move as a disaster and admission of failure. Soon after the announcement, an article in Digiday described how Google execs were now \u201cin full-on damage control mode, trying to soothe everyone\u2019s nerves, both publicly and behind the scenes.\u201d Meanwhile, digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called the move \u201cbad for your privacy and good for Google's business.\u201d \u201cBy abandoning this plan, Google leaves billions of Chrome users vulnerable to online surveillance,\u201d the EFF\u2019s Lena Cohen wrote. Other browsers including Apple\u2019s Safari have already eradicated third-party cookies that track people across the web and target them with adverts amid concerns about privacy. But as the world\u2019s biggest browser with more than 65 percent share, Chrome\u2019s decision to phase out cookies was set to be the final nail in the coffin for the intrusive trackers. The news, therefore, came as a shock to all sides. So why has Google undergone such a seemingly large U-turn on third-party cookies, how will Chrome include the online trackers going forward, and how will that impact your privacy? Don\u2019t Call It a Backtrack Google first announced it would be phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome in 2020. But the company has postponed the move several times after multiple attempts to find an alternative\u2014including the ill-fated FLoC. While it seems like a backtrack, Google argues its new approach offers control over privacy settings while continuing to support third-party cookies for those who want them. Google said in a blog post that it will allow people to \u201cmake an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, with the option to adjust that choice at any time.\u201d As this moves forward, it remains \u201cimportant for developers to have privacy-enhancing alternatives,\u201d a Google spokesperson told WIRED in an emailed statement. Sources familiar with the matter say Google\u2019s new plan will be similar to Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature. Introduced in 2021, ATT stipulates that advertisers must ask explicit permission before accessing a user\u2019s mobile advertising ID, the identifier for advertisers (IDFA), for tracking. This means people must click on a pop-up to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to tracking when using Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system. Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox APIs, designed to reduce reliance on third-party cookies, will still be available. The firm also intends to offer additional privacy controls and is planning to introduce IP Protection into Chrome's Incognito mode. In response to criticism, Google tells WIRED that \u201celevating user choice\u201d for third-party cookies \u201cis good for privacy.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s Privacy Sandbox reflects years of feedback and engagement from privacy advocates, users, regulators, and others across the industry,\u201d Google spokesperson Scott Westover says. \u201cAs this moves forward, we\u2019ll continue to collaborate with the industry to build toward the next era of online privacy together.\u201d Cookies, Crumbled Google might say it\u2019s keeping third-party cookies, but experts argue that the tracking technology is dead either way. This means advertisers are already having to find other ways to monetize users. \u201cWe should have an expectation that the value and utility of third-party cookies has essentially gone to zero,\u201d says Nick Gernert, CEO of WordPress VIP. \u201cAnyone making plans that leverage data from third-party cookies may have diminishing returns in the long run.\u201d The apparent death of cookies also won\u2019t matter much to Google, which has a ton of data from multiple services in addition to Chrome and can target people without cookies. According to Google's 2023 earnings report, $237.86 billion of the firm\u2019s $307.39 billion in revenue came from ads. Ads on its search engine results page and other products including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play are the highest earner at a collective $175.03 billion, or 56.9 percent of overall revenue. YouTube ads bring in $31.51 billion (10.3 percent of the total), and Google Network ads including ads on Google\u2019s partner sites come in at $31.31 billion, 10.2 percent of revenue. Network ad revenues were down by 4.5 percent last year, showing Google reliance on this area is reducing. Google knows it\u2019s quite possible privacy-conscious users will opt out of Chrome cookies, just as they did with Apple\u2019s ATT, which saw Facebook taking a $10 billion hit. Now, ATT opt-in rates range from 12 percent to 40 percent across different app categories. The mobile advertising industry has boomed over recent years, even with Apple\u2019s ATT in place, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security outfit ESET. He calls the results of ATT \u201cimpressive\u201d and suggests Google has been watching the outcome of Apple\u2019s rules before implementing its own version. Meanwhile, Google is already advising developers to act as if they don\u2019t have cookies. The tech giant is working under the assumption that even if 80 percent do opt out, 20 percent of Chrome\u2019s more than 3 billion users isn\u2019t a bad result. Ensuring users have a conscious choice over whether they use cookies or not is \u201ca good step in practice,\u201d says Simon Bain, CEO at data and analytics platform OmniIndex. But Google needs to consider how easy it is to opt out, he says. \u201cAnd is there a negative impact on opting out for users?\u201d Bain says. \u201cThese are crucial because if opting out is buried in the privacy settings and there is a reduction in functionality or workflow as a result of not having them, then it is not really a fair or legitimate choice.\u201d Informed Choice Google says its updated approach allows people to \u201cmake an informed choice that applies across their web browsing,\u201d and says you\u2019ll be able to \u201cadjust that choice at any time.\u201d The plan is for this to be as usable as possible. Sources familiar with the matter confirmed Google\u2019s current plan would be a prominent global prompt, meaning users would not be asked to make choices on a site-by-site basis. Yet some experts question Google\u2019s motives. Sean Wright, an independent security researcher, points out that Google has \u201can enormous amount of data on individuals,\u201d which gives a lot of power to \u201ca single entity.\u201d This level of control could put user privacy at risk, Wright says. \u201cMy concern is that you have a large company that is already well established, developing its own ecosystem with little competition. There seems little incentive to enhance the privacy of users.\u201d But Google argues that it has received feedback from \u201ca wide variety of stakeholders,\u201d including regulators such as the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, publishers, web developers and standards groups, civil society, and participants in the advertising industry. \u201cThis has helped us craft solutions that aim to support a competitive and thriving marketplace that works for publishers and advertisers, and encourage the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies,\u201d the company says. Even so, privacy is a difficult balance to strike for the world\u2019s biggest browser whose business model is designed to rely on advertising. This is already well known, and if you care about your privacy, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ve already ditched Chrome for another browser. If you haven\u2019t, Chrome alternatives include Apple\u2019s Safari, Brave, Vivaldi, Firefox, and the DuckDuckGo browser. Brave and Vivaldi and based on the same Chromium engine as Chrome, so they include some of the same functionality.\", \"headline\": \"What Google's U-Turn on Third-Party Cookies Means for Chrome Privacy\", \"summary\": \"Google has reversed its decision to abolish third-party cookies in Chrome, citing concerns from privacy advocates, regulators, and advertisers.

Prosecutors in the case against Adams, which centers on alleged illegal payments the mayor received from the Turkish government, revealed that the FBI still hasn't cracked the encryption on Adams' personal phone, nearly a year after it was seized. That phone is one of three that the bureau has taken from Adams, but agents seized Adams' personal phone a day later than the other two devices he used in an official capacity. By that time, Adams had not only changed the passcode on the phone from a four digit PIN to six digits\u2014a measure he says he took to prevent staffers from intentionally or unintentionally deleting information from the device. He also claims he immediately \u201cforgot\u201d that code to unlock it. That very convenient amnesia may leave the FBI and prosecutors in a situation similar to their investigation into the San Bernardino mass shooting carried out by Syed Rizwan Farook in 2016, when the US government demanded Apple help unlock the shooter's encrypted iPhone, leading to a high-profile standoff between the Apple and the FBI. In that case, the cybersecurity firm Azimuth eventually used a closely guarded\u2014and expensive\u2014hacking technique to unlock the device.

In 2022, Weist became a certified private investigator in New York State. In doing so, she unlocked the ability to access the vast array of surveillance software accessible to PIs. Weist could access DRN\u2019s analytics system, DRNsights, as part of a package through investigations company IRBsearch. (After Weist published an op-ed detailing her work, IRBsearch conducted an audit of her account and discontinued it. The company did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment.) \u201cThere is a difference between tools that are publicly accessible, like Google Street View, and things that are searchable,\u201d Weist says. While conducting her work, Weist ran multiple searches for words and popular terms, which found results far beyond license plates. In data she shared with WIRED, a search for \u201cPlanned Parenthood,\u201d for instance, returned stickers on cars, on bumpers, and in windows, both for and against the reproductive health services organization. Civil liberties groups have already raised concerns about how license-plate-reader data could be weaponized against those seeking abortion. Weist says she is concerned with how the search tools could be misused when there is increasing political violence and divisiveness in society. While not linked to license plate data, one law enforcement official in Ohio recently said people should \u201cwrite down\u201d the addresses of people who display yard signs supporting Vice President Kamala Harris, the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, exemplifying how a searchable database of citizens\u2019 political affiliations could be abused. A 2016 report by the Associated Press revealed widespread misuse of confidential law enforcement databases by police officers nationwide. In 2022, WIRED revealed that hundreds of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees and contractors were investigated for abusing similar databases, including LPR systems. The alleged misconduct in both reports ranged from stalking and harassment to sharing information with criminals. While people place signs in their lawns or bumper stickers on their cars to inform people of their views and potentially to influence those around them, the ACLU\u2019s Stanley says it is intended for \u201chuman-scale visibility,\u201d not that of machines. \u201cPerhaps they want to express themselves in their communities, to their neighbors, but they don't necessarily want to be logged into a nationwide database that\u2019s accessible to police authorities,\u201d Stanley says. Weist says the system, at the very least, should be able to filter out images that do not contain license plate data and not make mistakes. \u201cAny number of times is too many times, especially when it's finding stuff like what people are wearing or lawn signs,\u201d Weist says. \u201cLicense plate recognition (LPR) technology supports public safety and community services, from helping to find abducted children and stolen vehicles to automating toll collection and lowering insurance premiums by mitigating insurance fraud,\u201d Jeremiah Wheeler, the president of DRN, says in a statement. Weist believes that, given the relatively small number of images showing bumper stickers compared to the large number of vehicles with them, Motorola Solutions may be attempting to filter out images containing bumper stickers or other text. Wheeler did not respond to WIRED's questions about whether there are limits on what can be searched in license plate databases, why images of homes with lawn signs but no vehicles in sight appeared in search results, or if filters are used to reduce such images. \u201cDRNsights complies with all applicable laws and regulations,\u201d Wheeler says. \u201cThe DRNsights tool allows authorized parties to access license plate information and associated vehicle information that is captured in public locations and visible to all. Access is restricted to customers with certain permissible purposes under the law, and those in breach have their access revoked.\u201d AI Everywhere License-plate-recognition systems have flourished in recent years as cameras have become smaller and machine-learning algorithms have improved. These systems, such as DRN and rival Flock, mark part of a change in the way people are surveilled as they move around cities and neighborhoods. Increasingly, CCTV cameras are being equipped with AI to monitor people\u2019s movements and even detect their emotions. The systems have the potential to alert officials, who may not be able to constantly monitor CCTV footage, to real-world events. However, whether license plate recognition can reduce crime has been questioned. \u201cWhen government or private companies promote license plate readers, they make it sound like the technology is only looking for lawbreakers or people suspected of stealing a car or involved in an amber alert, but that\u2019s just not how the technology works,\u201d says Dave Maass, the director of investigations at civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cThe technology collects everyone's data and stores that data often for immense periods of time.\u201d Over time, the technology may become more capable, too. Maass, who has long researched license-plate-recognition systems, says companies are now trying to do \u201cvehicle fingerprinting,\u201d where they determine the make, model, and year of the vehicle based on its shape and also determine if there\u2019s damage to the vehicle. DRN\u2019s product pages say one upcoming update will allow insurance companies to see if a car is being used for ride-sharing. \u201cThe way that the country is set up was to protect citizens from government overreach, but there\u2019s not a lot put in place to protect us from private actors who are engaged in business meant to make money,\u201d Nicole McConlogue, an associate professor of law at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law, who has researched license-plate-surveillance systems and their potential for discrimination. \u201cThe volume that they\u2019re able to do this in is what makes it really troubling,\u201d McConlogue says of vehicles moving around streets collecting images. \u201cWhen you do that, you're carrying the incentives of the people that are collecting the data. But also, in the United States, you\u2019re carrying with it the legacy of segregation and redlining, because that left a mark on the composition of neighborhoods.\u201d\", \"headline\": \"License Plate Readers Are Creating a US-Wide Database of More Than Just Cars\", \"summary\": \"License plate readers are being used to capture more than just license plates, creating vast databases of personal information such as political affiliations and location data.

The one-year contract between the company\u2019s US subsidiary in Chantilly, Virginia, and ICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations Division 3 was signed on September 27 and covers a \u201cfully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance and training.\u201d Paragon has received the award under the FAR 6.302-1 rule reserved for unique and innovative services not otherwise available to the government and not via the typical competitive process. It is unknown whether the contract is for the deployment of Paragon\u2019s flagship product, Graphite\u2014a spyware that reportedly extracts data primarily from cloud backups\u2014or another of the company\u2019s products or services. ICE and Paragon did not immediately respond to WIRED\u2019s requests for comment. This is not Paragon\u2019s first government agency contract. The New York Times reported in December 2022 that the US Drug Enforcement Administration had used Graphite. Similarly, an intelligence publication reported in March 2023 that Paragon had landed a major contract in Singapore worth \u201ctens of millions of dollars.\u201d Paragon\u2019s contract comes amid a comprehensive effort by the US government to reshape the commercial spyware market over the past three years. Measures have included placing spyware vendors like NSO Group and Intellexa on the so-called Entity List to prevent any US companies from doing business with them; enacting a visa restriction policy against multiple individuals \u201cwho have been involved in the development and sale of commercial spyware or who are immediate family members of those involved,\u201d and imposing consecutive rounds of sanctions against spyware vendors. Many of these efforts followed President Joe Biden signing an executive order in March 2023 that effectively restricted the US government\u2019s use of commercial spyware technology while promoting its \u201cresponsible use\u201d that aligns with the protection of human rights. On a global level, the US is leading an initiative stipulated in the \u201cJoint Statement on Efforts to Counter the Proliferation and Misuse of Commercial Spyware,\u201d which now counts 21 signatories, including Germany, France, UK, Japan, and South Korea, while it recently announced that it would fund governments and civil society groups around the world to develop spyware-related research and regulation. Paragon, which characterizes itself as a scrupulous kind of spyware maker, is likely responding to the US government\u2019s global push for responsible surveillance. On the website of its US subsidiary, the company boasts that it provides its customers with \u201cethically based tools,\u201d while one of its investors maintains that the company\u2019s software provides \u201ccutting-edge capabilities that make the world safer.\u201d Elsewhere, Paragon states that it limits its extraction of information from targeted devices \u201cto conversations on chat apps\u201d and that it \u201cworks solely with police forces and intelligence agencies that meet the standards of an enlightened democracy, which includes only 39 countries.\u201d Paragon was founded in 2019 by veterans from the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 powerful intelligence Unit 8200 with the active involvement of former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak as an investor who is estimated to own a sizable slice of the company. The company has received investment from the Boston-headquartered Battery Ventures, \u201cconsidered to be one of the world\u2019s top venture capital firms,\u201d and two of its founders formerly worked for Blumberg Capital, another large US venture capital firm. Israeli media reported in June that a US private equity fund with a portfolio of security companies has been in talks to acquire control of Paragon, estimating its valuation at $1 billion. To secure its unique US-approved, \u201cethical\u201d positioning, Paragon has made \u201cdeliberate efforts\u201d since its establishment to break into the US market, notes the Atlantic Council. In 2019, as Paragon was developing Graphite, the company enlisted WestExec Advisors, a prominent Washington, DC, consulting firm cofounded by former Obama administration officials, including current US secretary of state Antony Blinken, to advise on its \u201cstrategic approach to the US and European markets,\u201d a company executive told the Financial Times. Avril Haines, a former WestExec staffer, is now the US director of national intelligence. To remain in the US government\u2019s \u201cgood graces,\u201d Paragon in February 2023 hired another DC-based lobbying firm, Holland & Knight, \u201cwith a good track record in avoiding sanctions,\u201d as some reports point out. Lobbying expenditure disclosure reveals a spend of a minimum $280,000 in 2023 and 2024 for this campaign. The fact that the spyware vendor has neither been placed on an entity list nor have any of its executives been sanctioned by the Biden administration suggests that Paragon\u2019s lobbying efforts have been successful. In addition, Biden\u2019s executive order leaves enough margin for the deployment of tools like Graphite. When a senior US administration official was asked specifically about potential abuses of Paragon\u2019s flagship product, they said that the executive order \u201crequires the heads of agencies to review any activity that might be relevant,\u201d without excluding the possibility of lawful use. Meanwhile, the company continues to grow and is advertising several roles in Israel. In the US, Paragon boosted its presence in the wake of the signing of the executive order and started hiring intelligence veterans, including former CIA and FBI officers at its subsidiary, \u201choping it would pick up new business.\u201d Fresh reports from February 2024 confirmed the steady growth. Paragon\u2019s $2 million contract with ICE is tangible proof that the company\u2019s approach is paying off. It remains to be seen whether Graphite's deployment will align with the protection of human rights, privacy, and democracy.\", \"headline\": \"ICE Signs $2 Million Contract With Spyware Maker Paragon Solutions\", \"summary\": \"ICE has signed a $2 million contract with Paragon Solutions, a spyware vendor, despite the Biden administration's efforts to crack down on commercial spyware.

For the first time, Apple is taking your phone\u2019s ability to save login details and putting them in a standalone app. It could help improve millions of people\u2019s terrible passwords. After years of being told you should create unique, strong passwords for every website and app you use, you probably fall into one of two camps: people that are fully signed up to the password manager life, or those still using \u201c123456\u201d for every other website. Apple\u2019s new encrypted Passwords app is automatically included with iOS 18, and is a public-facing evolution of its Keychain and password-saving capabilities. The Keychain, which has existed for more than a decade, no longer has as prominent a home in the iPhone\u2019s settings, and details previously saved there are being moved to the new app. The launch of the password manager app, which will also be available on macOS Sequoia and iPadOS 18, may help improve people\u2019s relationships with their passwords but also could, to varying degrees, challenge existing password managers. \u201cThis move makes the app more visible to lay users and informs them about this secure method to store and manage passwords,\u201d says Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk from security company Mysk. \u201cYou have a default password manager preinstalled on your device [that] provides end-to-end encryption when syncing data across devices.\u201d New Passwords The Passwords app has a pretty barebones design. Six different tiles are presented when you open the app on an iPhone: All, Passkeys, Codes, Wi-Fi, Security, and Deleted. These are essentially the main functions of the app, allowing you to save each type of data within their relevant sections. The security section includes check-ups allowing weak and exposed passwords to be identified. \u201cThis will definitely boost the adoption of this preinstalled app and bolster user security,\u201d Bakry and Mysk say. They add that it presents the saved data \u201cin a more organized way than the Settings app.\u201d Apple says the Passwords app uses end-to-end encryption to save your details, meaning nobody, not even Apple, knows what you have saved. Within the app, you can search for login details to your entries and set up groups to share passwords with other people. Your saved login details are synced across Apple devices using iCloud, meaning the encrypted data is shared with Apple\u2019s cloud servers and available on all of your Apple devices. Within Apple\u2019s settings, you can turn off syncing passwords on a specific device. The app is locked using Face ID. When using the Passwords app, any details you have previously saved in Keychain or AutoFill will be moved to the new location. This includes if you have used the Sign in with Apple login system on any websites or apps. It is unclear why Apple has decided to spin its Keychain system into a fully fledged password manager now, although the company has been building out the individual features over a number of years. (Apple has not responded to WIRED\u2019s request for comment at the time of writing.) For many people, having a standalone password manager app from Apple could encourage better password practices. Siamak Shahandashti, a senior lecturer in the University of York\u2019s cybersecurity and privacy research group, says the move from Apple may be a usability decision. Making Passwords visible could encourage people to take their passwords seriously. \u201cWe need to design authentication systems for human beings,\u201d Shahandashti says. \u201cWe cannot expect users to maintain a hundred accounts, for each of them [to] use a strong password. It\u2019s actually the fault of the designers because these systems have not been designed for users considering the capability of an average human being.\u201d Death of the Password Passwords are slowly dying. Enter the passkey. For the past couple of years, websites, apps, and phone manufacturers have been in the process of rolling out passkeys\u2014a technology that replaces passwords, is more secure, and doesn\u2019t require you to remember any complex login details. (Although passkeys still have some teething problems.) Leona Lassak, a research assistant at Ruhr-University Bochum who has studied passkey adoption, says greater \u201cvisibility\u201d of the Passwords app can help get the sign-in technology to a broader audience, one which might not use a password manager otherwise. Apple\u2019s Passwords app could help with the perception and transition to passkeys, Lassak says. \u201cThere has been discussion about the need for passkey managers, because once we actually use them on websites, there's probably going to be multiple for each website,\u201d she says. The app is also, at least subtly, encouraging the adoption of passkeys. Within Passwords\u2019 settings, accessed through Apple\u2019s System preferences, there\u2019s the option to turn on \u201cautomatic\u201d passkey upgrades, which will allow existing accounts to use passkeys when they are available. Lock In Password managers have existed for years and there are plenty of options you can use, from open source apps to browser-based management systems. Each comes with their own particular set of pros and cons. Apple wading into the password management market by including a new app on millions of iPhones, Macs, and iPads could also impact the wider ecosystem. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that Apple\u2019s Passwords app would \u2018sherlock\u2019 third-party password managers\u2014or make them less attractive,\u201d say Bakry and Mysk, highlighting that people need to use iCloud to sync passwords in Apple\u2019s system, and that those who are privacy conscious may not want this to happen automatically. There\u2019s also the risk of locking people into Apple\u2019s password manager\u2014at launch, there appear to be no options to export the saved data and use it in a commercial alternative. One competitor password manager has stressed that their software works on products \u201cbeyond\u201d the \u201cApple ecosystem.\u201d (People using Apple\u2019s password management software on Windows devices can access saved details through iCloud for Windows.) Ultimately, what password manager you use should reflect what type of software you want to support and the individual threats you may face. For many, Apple\u2019s new app is probably better than not using a password manager at all.\", \"headline\": \"Apple\u2019s New Passwords App May Solve Your Login Nightmares\", \"summary\": \"Apple has launched its first standalone password manager app called 'Passwords' with iOS 18.

That phone is one of three that the bureau has taken from Adams, but agents seized Adams' personal phone a day later than the other two devices he used in an official capacity.

Paragon, which characterizes itself as a scrupulous kind of spyware maker, is likely responding to the US government\u2019s global push for responsible surveillance. On the website of its US subsidiary, the company boasts that it provides its customers with \u201cethically based tools,\u201d while one of its investors maintains that the company\u2019s software provides \u201ccutting-edge capabilities that make the world safer.\u201d Elsewhere, Paragon states that it limits its extraction of information from targeted devices \u201cto conversations on chat apps\u201d and that it \u201cworks solely with police forces and intelligence agencies that meet the standards of an enlightened democracy, which includes only 39 countries.\u201d Paragon was founded in 2019 by veterans from the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 powerful intelligence Unit 8200 with the active involvement of former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak as an investor who is estimated to own a sizable slice of the company. The company has received investment from the Boston-headquartered Battery Ventures, \u201cconsidered to be one of the world\u2019s top venture capital firms,\u201d and two of its founders formerly worked for Blumberg Capital, another large US venture capital firm. Israeli media reported in June that a US private equity fund with a portfolio of security companies has been in talks to acquire control of Paragon, estimating its valuation at $1 billion. To secure its unique US-approved, \u201cethical\u201d positioning, Paragon has made \u201cdeliberate efforts\u201d since its establishment to break into the US market, notes the Atlantic Council. In 2019, as Paragon was developing Graphite, the company enlisted WestExec Advisors, a prominent Washington, DC, consulting firm cofounded by former Obama administration officials, including current US secretary of state Antony Blinken, to advise on its \u201cstrategic approach to the US and European markets,\u201d a company executive told the Financial Times. Avril Haines, a former WestExec staffer, is now the US director of national intelligence. To remain in the US government\u2019s \u201cgood graces,\u201d Paragon in February 2023 hired another DC-based lobbying firm, Holland & Knight, \u201cwith a good track record in avoiding sanctions,\u201d as some reports point out. Lobbying expenditure disclosure reveals a spend of a minimum $280,000 in 2023 and 2024 for this campaign. The fact that the spyware vendor has neither been placed on an entity list nor have any of its executives been sanctioned by the Biden administration suggests that Paragon\u2019s lobbying efforts have been successful. In addition, Biden\u2019s executive order leaves enough margin for the deployment of tools like Graphite. When a senior US administration official was asked specifically about potential abuses of Paragon\u2019s flagship product, they said that the executive order \u201crequires the heads of agencies to review any activity that might be relevant,\u201d without excluding the possibility of lawful use. Meanwhile, the company continues to grow and is advertising several roles in Israel. In the US, Paragon boosted its presence in the wake of the signing of the executive order and started hiring intelligence veterans, including former CIA and FBI officers at its subsidiary, \u201choping it would pick up new business.\u201d Fresh reports from February 2024 confirmed the steady growth. Paragon\u2019s $2 million contract with ICE is tangible proof that the company\u2019s approach is paying off.

When using the Passwords app, any details you have previously saved in Keychain or AutoFill will be moved to the new location. This includes if you have used the Sign in with Apple login system on any websites or apps. It is unclear why Apple has decided to spin its Keychain system into a fully fledged password manager now, although the company has been building out the individual features over a number of years. (Apple has not responded to WIRED\u2019s request for comment at the time of writing.) For many people, having a standalone password manager app from Apple could encourage better password practices. Siamak Shahandashti, a senior lecturer in the University of York\u2019s cybersecurity and privacy research group, says the move from Apple may be a usability decision. Making Passwords visible could encourage people to take their passwords seriously. \u201cWe need to design authentication systems for human beings,\u201d Shahandashti says. \u201cWe cannot expect users to maintain a hundred accounts, for each of them [to] use a strong password. It\u2019s actually the fault of the designers because these systems have not been designed for users considering the capability of an average human being.\u201d Passwords are slowly dying. Enter the passkey. For the past couple of years, websites, apps, and phone manufacturers have been in the process of rolling out passkeys\u2014a technology that replaces passwords, is more secure, and doesn\u2019t require you to remember any complex login details. (Although passkeys still have some teething problems.) Leona Lassak, a research assistant at Ruhr-University Bochum who has studied passkey adoption, says greater \u201cvisibility\u201d of the Passwords app can help get the sign-in technology to a broader audience, one which might not use a password manager otherwise. Apple\u2019s Passwords app could help with the perception and transition to passkeys, Lassak says. \u201cThere has been discussion about the need for passkey managers, because once we actually use them on websites, there's probably going to be multiple for each website,\u201d she says. The app is also, at least subtly, encouraging the adoption of passkeys. Within Passwords\u2019 settings, accessed through Apple\u2019s System preferences, there\u2019s the option to turn on \u201cautomatic\u201d passkey upgrades, which will allow existing accounts to use passkeys when they are available. Password managers have existed for years and there are plenty of options you can use, from open source apps to browser-based management systems. Each comes with their own particular set of pros and cons. Apple wading into the password management market by including a new app on millions of iPhones, Macs, and iPads could also impact the wider ecosystem. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that Apple\u2019s Passwords app would \u2018sherlock\u2019 third-party password managers\u2014or make them less attractive,\u201d say Bakry and Mysk, highlighting that people need to use iCloud to sync passwords in Apple\u2019s system, and that those who are privacy conscious may not want this to happen automatically. There\u2019s also the risk of locking people into Apple\u2019s password manager\u2014at launch, there appear to be no options to export the saved data and use it in a commercial alternative. One competitor password manager has stressed that their software works on products \u201cbeyond\u201d the \u201cApple ecosystem.\u201d (People using Apple\u2019s password management software on Windows devices can access saved details through iCloud for Windows.) Ultimately, what password manager you use should reflect what type of software you want to support and the individual threats you may face. For many, Apple\u2019s new app is probably better than not using a password manager at all.\", \"headline\": \"Apple\u2019s New Passwords App May Solve Your Login Nightmares\", \"summary\": \"Apple is launching its first stand-alone password manager app in iOS 18.

The idea is to provide as much privacy as possible while offering powerful AI functionality, says Camden Woollven, group head of AI at GRC International Group, an IT governance firm. \u201cThis means you could potentially see some pretty sophisticated AI, even on midrange smartphones.\u201d But this type of hybrid AI processing still may pose risks because some data is sent to cloud servers without the levels of accountability that Apple offers with its PCC. \u201cWith hybrid AI, some data must leave the device and be processed elsewhere, making it more susceptible to interception or misuse,\u201d says Riccardo Ocleppo, founder and director of Open Institute of Technology, which provides technology-focused courses. Yet Google and its hardware partners argue privacy and security are a major focus of the Android AI approach. VP Justin Choi, head of the security team, mobile eXperience business at Samsung Electronics, says its hybrid AI offers users \u201ccontrol over their data and uncompromising privacy.\u201d Choi describes how features processed in the cloud are protected by servers governed by strict policies. \u201cOur on-device AI features provide another element of security by performing tasks locally on the device with no reliance on cloud servers, neither storing data on the device nor uploading it to the cloud,\u201d Choi says. Google says its data centers are designed with robust security measures, including physical security, access controls, and data encryption. When processing AI requests in the cloud, the company says, data stays within secure Google data center architecture and the firm is not sending your information to third parties. Meanwhile, Galaxy\u2019s AI engines are not trained with user data from on-device features, says Choi. Samsung \u201cclearly indicates\u201d which AI functions run on the device with its Galaxy AI symbol, and the smartphone maker adds a watermark to show when content has used generative AI. The firm has also introduced a new security and privacy option called Advanced Intelligence settings to give users the choice to disable cloud-based AI capabilities. Google says it \u201chas a long history of protecting user data privacy,\u201d adding that this applies to its AI features powered on-device and in the cloud. \u201cWe utilize on-device models, where data never leaves the phone, for sensitive cases such as screening phone calls,\u201d Suzanne Frey, vice president of product trust at Google, tells WIRED. Frey describes how Google products rely on its cloud-based models, which she says ensures \u201cconsumer's information, like sensitive information that you want to summarize, is never sent to a third party for processing.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve remained committed to building AI-powered features that people can trust because they are secure by default and private by design, and most importantly, follow Google\u2019s responsible AI principles that were first to be championed in the industry,\u201d Frey says. Rather than simply matching the \u201chybrid\u201d approach to data processing, experts say Apple\u2019s AI strategy has changed the nature of the conversation. \u201cEveryone expected this on-device, privacy-first push, but what Apple actually did was say, it doesn\u2019t matter what you do in AI\u2014or where\u2014it\u2019s how you do it,\u201d Doffman says. He thinks this \u201cwill likely define best practice across the smartphone AI space.\u201d Even so, Apple hasn\u2019t won the AI privacy battle just yet: The deal with OpenAI\u2014which sees Apple uncharacteristically opening up its iOS ecosystem to an outside vendor\u2014could put a dent in its privacy claims. Apple refutes Musk\u2019s claims that the OpenAI partnership compromises iPhone security, with \u201cprivacy protections built in for users who access ChatGPT.\u201d The company says you will be asked permission before your query is shared with ChatGPT, while IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI will not store requests\u2014but ChatGPT\u2019s data use policies still apply. Partnering with another company is a \u201cstrange move\u201d for Apple, but the decision \u201cwould not have been taken lightly,\u201d says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security firm ESET. While the exact privacy implications are not yet clear, he concedes that \u201csome personal data may be collected on both sides and potentially analyzed by OpenAI.\u201d This means for some data, \u201cyou're stuck with OpenAI's rules,\u201d says Schneier. \u201cApple strips identifying information when sending OpenAI the queries, but there's a lot of identifying information in many queries.\u201d The collaboration between Apple and OpenAI has the potential to \u201ctotally reshape accountability across the AI landscape,\u201d says Andy Pardoe, a professor of artificial intelligence and founder of tech consultancy Wisdom Works Group. \u201cPartnerships like this distribute liability across multiple different entities, impacting how responsibility is assigned for the successes and potential failures within their interconnected systems.\u201d There are also security risks to be considered as AI technology is integrated into tech giants\u2019 operating systems. While Apple Intelligence is an impressive feat in theory at least, the firm\u2019s AI tools also create \u201ca huge attack surface that's never before seen the light of day,\u201d Doffman says. \u201cIt takes a raft of different security innovations and combines them in a new offering for a new purpose, so if it works, it's a game changer. But there will be issues when it goes live that Apple will need to manage.\u201d It is for this reason that Apple and Google are encouraging security researchers to find holes in their AI solutions. Google\u2019s Secure AI Framework sees security outfit Mandiant test the defenses of AI models. An Apple spokesperson provided links to its PCC security paper and the model paper detailing its \u201cresponsible\u201d approach to AI development. Apple did not have an on-the-record response to WIRED\u2019s follow-up questions regarding privacy concerns related to its OpenAI partnership or potential security risks. Apple is using a model it calls \u201cverifiable transparency\u201d for PCC. \u201cWe want to ensure that security and privacy researchers can inspect Private Cloud Compute software, verify its functionality and help identify issues\u2014just like they can with Apple devices,\u201d Apple said in a blog post introducing PCC. To allow this, Apple is making software images of every production build of PCC publicly available for security researchers. Apple Intelligence will be integrated into its soon-to-launch iOS 18 software update alongside ChatGPT, with the full suite of features coming to the iPhone 16 this fall. You will be able to switch it off, but if you want to use AI features on any device, it is wise to consider the privacy and security implications. When choosing between iOS and Android AI specifically, it comes down to who you trust. Pardoe recommends evaluating the operating systems\u2019 overall trade-offs in terms of privacy features, data-handling practices, and transparency. That said, as Pardoe points out, \u201cApple's strong privacy focus remains a key highlight for users who prioritize data security above all else.\u201d\", \"headline\": \"How Apple Intelligence\u2019s Privacy Stacks Up Against Android\u2019s \u2018Hybrid AI\u2019\", \"summary\": \"Apple announced a late but major move into AI with \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d, which they say is a new way of protecting people\u2019s data with its Private Cloud Compute (PCC) system.

I know there are few combinations of words less interesting than business, email, and compromise. I may as well have written an article about fiber, socks, and responsibility. But this isn\u2019t a boring article; it\u2019s an article about email con artists who, according to the FBI, are pulling in $26 billion a year by scamming people. So yeah, business email compromise (BEC) scams are a big deal. The con artists behind this criminal enterprise will cold-email you, pretending to be someone you work with, in order to gain access to money or information. You might get an email that appears to be from your company\u2019s CEO asking you to quickly do something like buy gift cards, or you might get an email that looks like it\u2019s from an employee at your company asking you to change their direct deposit information. The scam itself can take a lot of forms, but the end goal is to somehow siphon money away from you or the business you work for. It\u2019s worth it for anyone with a desk job to take a few moments to learn how to spot these emails. I talked with a few experts, and they passed along some helpful advice. When I asked two cybersecurity experts about BEC fraud, I expected them to lead with technical advice. Both started with emotions. This makes sense: While such fraud happens on computers, it is at its heart about psychological manipulation. So spotting an email compromise scam requires getting in touch with how you\u2019re feeling. \u201cIf an email elicits an emotional response, take a step back and reread it when you\u2019re more calm,\u201d says Ronnie Tokazowski, a security researcher who has been working to educate people about email scams for over a decade. Tokazowski emphasizes how important creating a false sense of urgency is to such scams. The stress the scam induces is what keeps you from questioning the premise. \u201cPeople who get pulled into these types of scams \u2026 their emotions get very deregulated,\u201d he says. That makes you less capable of thinking critically, which is a key part of how such scams work. Selena Larson, a threat researcher at cybersecurity firm Proofpoint, went a step further. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can print this, but honestly: Just breathe,\u201d she says. \u201cSlow down, take a deep breath. That actually helps you think more clearly and rationally. Walk away from your computer or your phone and think critically. Would this be an email that someone would send me? Is this is a logical thing that I\u2019m being asked to do?\u201d You should be particularly skeptical if the person sending the email asks you to keep something quiet. \u201cScammers do things like isolate you from your peers,\u201d says Larson. \u201cThey come at you from a position of authority and say things like, \u2018Please keep this confidential and only between us.\u2019 This type of social engineering makes it so people feel like they have to take an action with some kind of urgency, and that you can\u2019t share it with anybody.\u201d So this is the first step: Take control of your emotions. Yes, it can be difficult if you work in a demanding field. But it\u2019s your best first defense, and your employer will thank you for it (or, at least, they should). Now that you\u2019re skeptically questioning the legitimacy of the urgent request, check to make sure the email is coming from the person it claims to be from. The best way to do this is to ask\u2014just be careful. \u201cIf you received an email like this, it\u2019s important to pick up the phone and call the number you know to be legitimate,\u201d says Larson, adding a caveat. \u201cDo not rely on a phone number in the email itself\u2014it will be owned by the threat actor.\u201d This is a crucial point: Any contact information in the email itself is likely compromised, and sometimes cleverly so. Use the phone number you\u2019ve already saved in your phone for the person in question, or look up the phone number on an official website or in an official company directory. This applies even if the number in the email looks correct, because some scammers will go through the trouble of getting a phone number that\u2019s similar to that of the person they\u2019re impersonating, all on the hopes that you\u2019ll call that number instead of the real one. \u201cI\u2019ve seen phone numbers off two digits from the actual phone number,\u201d says Tokazowski. Call the person who supposedly emailed you\u2014using a number you are 100 percent sure is real\u2014and confirm the request is authentic. You could also use some other secure communication channel like Slack or Microsoft Teams, or, if they\u2019re in the office, just ask them face to face. The point is to confirm any urgent request somewhere outside of the initial email. And even if the person is your boss or some other bigwig, do not worry about wasting their time. \u201cThe person that is being impersonated would so much rather have someone take the time to confirm than to lose thousands or a million dollars in a malicious transaction,\u201d says Larson. Getting in touch with the supposed sender isn\u2019t always an option. If not, there are a few tricks you can use to spot whether an email is real or fake. The first: check the email address and make sure it\u2019s from the company domain. \u201cAlways check the domains that you\u2019re receiving emails from,\u201d says Larson. Sometimes this will be obvious; your CEO likely isn\u2019t emailing you from a Gmail account, for example. Sometimes it will be more subtle\u2014fraudsters have been known to purchase domains that look similar to that of the company they\u2019re attempting to defraud, all in the hopes of appearing legitimate. It\u2019s also worth checking to see if the email signature matches the address the email is coming from. \u201cIf you look in the footer, they\u2019ll use the actual domain of the company to make it look legitimate, but that won\u2019t match the email address,\u201d says Larson. Just keep in mind that the difference might be subtle. \u201cLook-alike domains are very common: Someone will do a slight variation, like an \u2018l\u2019 instead of an \u2018i\u2019, to make it look legitimate.\u201d One way to test that, if you\u2019re suspicious, is to copy and paste the domain half of the address into a browser. If you don\u2019t get a website, you\u2019re probably dealing with a fake. Another trick scammers will use is email spoofing, which you can spot by clicking reply and checking the email address that shows up in the \"  \n  , \"headline\": \"How to Spot a Business Email Compromise Scam\", \"summary\": \"In a business email compromise scam, a criminal pretends to be your boss or coworker and emails you asking for a favor involving money.

That\u2019s a win for Google, which has long backed RCS on Android. But what actually is RCS? And why does supporting it matter? The short version: It\u2019s an upgrade on the standard SMS/MMS texting standards that smartphones have been using from the start. It brings better support for all the cool features we\u2019re used to in our messaging apps, like read receipts and images, and it adds some extra security layers too. Yes, it\u2019s a lot like using iMessage from Apple, or using WhatsApp\u2014though it\u2019s not quite that simple. There\u2019s no RCS app you can install, but you can find apps that support the RCS standard, as we\u2019ll explain. So the long version: Rich Communication Services is a fundamental standard rather than an app like WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram. It requires carrier support to work, which is why adoption was slow in the beginning, though RCS now works across most countries and is supported by AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) weren\u2019t really built for the modern way that we communicate through our phones, and RCS tries to fix that. It adds or improves support for sharing large-resolution images and video, group chatting, read receipts, video calls, and messages that actually go beyond 160 characters. When RCS is supported in your phone\u2019s default texting app, you can add reactions to messages, see when someone else is typing, and drop extra elements like GIFs, stickers, and your current location into conversations\u2014all features you may well be used to and accept as standard in other apps. There are changes and upgrades behind the scenes as well. Whereas SMS/MMS requires a data connection to your cellular network, RCS works over cell networks as well as Wi-Fi. If you don\u2019t have a cell signal for whatever reason but you can find a wireless network, your message can still go through. The standard also brings end-to-end encryption with it. It means that no one else\u2014not even Google or your carrier\u2014can see the conversation that\u2019s taking place, because only the devices involved in the conversation have the keys necessary to decrypt it. End-to-end encryption is a security feature you should look for in any app that handles sensitive information, including communications. It\u2019s a clear upgrade, which is why Google Messages and Samsung Messages now support it\u2014the messaging apps you\u2019ll find on Pixel phones and Galaxy phones, respectively. In November 2023, Apple finally relented and agreed to support RCS on the iPhone in 2024, though this course correction perhaps had more to do with concerns about antitrust procedures than any newfound sense of camaraderie with Google. Now we know that iPhone RCS support is going to arrive in September with iOS 18. This means all of those features we\u2019ve mentioned\u2014from read receipts to message reactions\u2014will work inside the iOS Messages app. However, Android users are still going to show up as green bubbles, as the RCS standard isn\u2019t going to be fully integrated with the iMessage platform that Apple operates. When you\u2019re texting someone with RCS enabled, you\u2019ll see \u201cText Message RCS\u201d inside the text input box in Messages on iOS, indicating that the recipient can take advantage of all the modern messaging features that we\u2019re now used to. There\u2019s no need to turn RCS on or off\u2014it\u2019s automatically enabled if you\u2019re chatting with a contact who has a device that supports RCS. With iOS 18 still in its development stage, there might be changes to come for how RCS is handled on iPhones before the software is rolled out to all compatible devices later in the year. This version of iOS will work on any iPhone models launched in 2018 or later, so most Apple handsets currently in use will get the software and RCS. It\u2019s the same with Samsung Messages: RCS is simply enabled when available. It\u2019s Google Messages for Android that gives you most control over RCS settings, and you can get to them from inside the app by tapping your profile picture (top right), then selecting Messages settings. Choose RCS chats and you\u2019re able to turn features such as read receipts and typing indicators on or off. With RCS soon to appear on iPhones and now extensively supported on Android devices, it\u2019s going to become less and less likely that your phone will need to revert back to SMS\u2014though it will do this if RCS isn\u2019t available for whatever reason. Otherwise, the standard that has powered our text messages since 1992 will finally be able to enjoy a well-earned retirement.\", \"headline\": \"A Guide to RCS, Why Apple\u2019s Adopting It, and How It Makes Texting Better\", \"summary\": \"Apple is bringing the RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging standard to iPhones in iOS 18.

Here\u2019s what you need to know.After years of being told you should create unique, strong passwords for every website and app you use, you probably fall into one of two camps: people that are fully signed up to the password manager life, or those still using \u201c123456\u201d for every other website.Apple\u2019s new encrypted Passwords app is automatically included with iOS 18, and is a public-facing evolution of its Keychain and password-saving capabilities. The Keychain, which has existed for more than a decade, no longer has as prominent a home in the iPhone\u2019s settings, and details previously saved there are being moved to the new app.The launch of the password manager app, which will also be available on macOS Sequoia and iPadOS 18, may help improve people\u2019s relationships with their passwords but also could, to varying degrees, challenge existing password managers.\u201cThis move makes the app more visible to lay users and informs them about this secure method to store and manage passwords,\u201d says Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk from security company Mysk. \u201cYou have a default password manager preinstalled on your device [that] provides end-to-end encryption when syncing data across devices.\u201dThe Passwords app has a pretty barebones design. Six different tiles are presented when you open the app on an iPhone: All, Passkeys, Codes, Wi-Fi, Security, and Deleted. These are essentially the main functions of the app, allowing you to save each type of data within their relevant sections. The security section includes check-ups allowing weak and exposed passwords to be identified.\u201cThis will definitely boost the adoption of this preinstalled app and bolster user security,\u201d Bakry and Mysk say. They add that it presents the saved data \u201cin a more organized way than the Settings app.\u201dApple says the Passwords app uses end-to-end encryption to save your details, meaning nobody, not even Apple, knows what you have saved. Within the app, you can search for login details to your entries and set up groups to share passwords with other people.Your saved login details are synced across Apple devices using iCloud, meaning the encrypted data is shared with Apple\u2019s cloud servers and available on all of your Apple devices. Within Apple\u2019s settings, you can turn off syncing passwords on a specific device. The app is locked using Face ID.When using the Passwords app, any details you have previously saved in Keychain or AutoFill will be moved to the new location. This includes if you have used the Sign in with Apple login system on any websites or apps. It is unclear why Apple has decided to spin its Keychain system into a fully fledged password manager now, although the company has been building out the individual features over a number of years. (Apple has not responded to WIRED\u2019s request for comment at the time of writing.)For many people, having a standalone password manager app from Apple could encourage better password practices. Siamak Shahandashti, a senior lecturer in the University of York\u2019s cybersecurity and privacy research group, says the move from Apple may be a usability decision. Making Passwords visible could encourage people to take their passwords seriously.\u201cWe need to design authentication systems for human beings,\u201d Shahandashti says. \u201cWe cannot expect users to maintain a hundred accounts, for each of them [to] use a strong password. It\u2019s actually the fault of the designers because these systems have not been designed for users considering the capability of an average human being.\u201dPasswords are slowly dying. Enter the passkey. For the past couple of years, websites, apps, and phone manufacturers have been in the process of rolling out passkeys\u2014a technology that replaces passwords, is more secure, and doesn\u2019t require you to remember any complex login details. (Although passkeys still have some teething problems.)Leona Lassak, a research assistant at Ruhr-University Bochum who has studied passkey adoption, says greater \u201cvisibility\u201d of the Passwords app can help get the sign-in technology to a broader audience, one which might not use a password manager otherwise. Apple\u2019s Passwords app could help with the perception and transition to passkeys, Lassak says. \u201cThere has been discussion about the need for passkey managers, because once we actually use them on websites, there's probably going to be multiple for each website,\u201d she says.The app is also, at least subtly, encouraging the adoption of passkeys. Within Passwords\u2019 settings, accessed through Apple\u2019s System preferences, there\u2019s the option to turn on \u201cautomatic\u201d passkey upgrades, which will allow existing accounts to use passkeys when they are available.Password managers have existed for years and there are plenty of options you can use, from open source apps to browser-based management systems. Each comes with their own particular set of pros and cons.Apple wading into the password management market by including a new app on millions of iPhones, Macs, and iPads could also impact the wider ecosystem. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that Apple\u2019s Passwords app would \u2018sherlock\u2019 third-party password managers\u2014or make them less attractive,\u201d say Bakry and Mysk, highlighting that people need to use iCloud to sync passwords in Apple\u2019s system, and that those who are privacy conscious may not want this to happen automatically.There\u2019s also the risk of locking people into Apple\u2019s password manager\u2014at launch, there appear to be no options to export the saved data and use it in a commercial alternative. One competitor password manager has stressed that their software works on products \u201cbeyond\u201d the \u201cApple ecosystem.\u201d (People using Apple\u2019s password management software on Windows devices can access saved details through iCloud for Windows.)Ultimately, what password manager you use should reflect what type of software you want to support and the individual threats you may face. For many, Apple\u2019s new app is probably better than not using a password manager at all.\", \"headline\": \"Apple\u2019s New Passwords App May Solve Your Login Nightmares\", \"summary\": \"Apple is launching its first stand-alone password manager app in iOS 18, called Passwords.

There are a lot of moving parts to it, but I think they've done pretty well.\u201dAnd so far, there\u2019s nothing else quite like it. \u201cHybrid AI\u201d used on Samsung Galaxy devices running Google Android and Google\u2019s Nano range sees some AI processes handled locally, leveraging cloud when necessary to enable more advanced capabilities.The idea is to provide as much privacy as possible while offering powerful AI functionality, says Camden Woollven, group head of AI at GRC International Group, an IT governance firm. \u201cThis means you could potentially see some pretty sophisticated AI, even on midrange smartphones.\u201dBut this type of hybrid AI processing still may pose risks because some data is sent to cloud servers without the levels of accountability that Apple offers with its PCC. \u201cWith hybrid AI, some data must leave the device and be processed elsewhere, making it more susceptible to interception or misuse,\u201d says Riccardo Ocleppo, founder and director of Open Institute of Technology, which provides technology-focused courses.Yet Google and its hardware partners argue privacy and security are a major focus of the Android AI approach. VP Justin Choi, head of the security team, mobile eXperience business at\u00a0Samsung\u00a0Electronics, says its hybrid AI offers users \u201ccontrol over their data and uncompromising privacy.\u201dChoi describes how features processed in the cloud\u00a0are protected by servers governed by strict policies. \u201cOur on-device AI features provide another element of security by performing tasks locally on the device with no reliance on cloud servers, neither storing data on the device nor uploading it to the cloud,\u201d Choi says.Google says its data centers are designed with robust security measures, including physical security, access controls, and data encryption.

That's a win for Google, which has long backed RCS on Android. But what actually is RCS? And why does supporting it matter?The short version: It's an upgrade on the standard SMS/MMS texting standards that smartphones have been using from the start. It brings better support for all the cool features we're used to in our messaging apps, like read receipts and images, and it adds some extra security layers too.Yes, it's a lot like using iMessage from Apple, or using WhatsApp\u2014though it's not quite that simple. There's no RCS app you can install, but you can find apps that support the RCS standard, as we'll explain.So the long version: Rich Communication Services is a fundamental standard rather than an app like WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram. It requires carrier support to work, which is why adoption was slow in the beginning, though RCS now works across most countries and is supported by AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) weren't really built for the modern way that we communicate through our phones, and RCS tries to fix that. It adds or improves support for sharing large-resolution images and video, group chatting, read receipts, video calls, and messages that actually go beyond 160 characters.When RCS is supported in your phone's default texting app, you can add reactions to messages, see when someone else is typing, and drop extra elements like GIFs, stickers, and your current location into conversations\u2014all features you may well be used to and accept as standard in other apps.There are changes and upgrades behind the scenes as well. Whereas SMS/MMS requires a data connection to your cellular network, RCS works over cell networks as well as Wi-Fi. If you don't have a cell signal for whatever reason but you can find a wireless network, your message can still go through.The standard also brings end-to-end encryption with it. It means that no one else\u2014not even Google or your carrier\u2014can see the conversation that's taking place, because only the devices involved in the conversation have the keys necessary to decrypt it. End-to-end encryption is a security feature you should look for in any app that handles sensitive information, including communications.It's a clear upgrade, which is why Google Messages and Samsung Messages now support it\u2014the messaging apps you'll find on Pixel phones and Galaxy phones, respectively. In November 2023, Apple finally relented and agreed to support RCS on the iPhone in 2024, though this course correction perhaps had more to do with concerns about antitrust procedures than any newfound sense of camaraderie with Google.Now we know that iPhone RCS support is going to arrive in September with iOS 18. This means all of those features we've mentioned\u2014from read receipts to message reactions\u2014will work inside the iOS Messages app. However, Android users are still going to show up as green bubbles, as the RCS standard isn't going to be fully integrated with the iMessage platform that Apple operates.When you're texting someone with RCS enabled, you'll see \"  , \"headline\": \"A Guide to RCS, Why Apple\u2019s Adopting It, and How It Makes Texting Better\", \"summary\": \"Apple is bringing the RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging standard to iPhones later this year with iOS 18.

(MSI), a subsidiary of British defense contractor Ultra that specializes in human-machine interfaces, the FMCU offers a similar form factor to the standard Xbox or PlayStation controller but with a ruggedized design intended to safeguard its sensitive electronics against whatever hostile environs American service members may find themselves in. A longtime developer of joysticks used on various US naval systems and aircraft, MSI has served as a subcontractor to major defense \u201cprimes\u201d like General Atomics, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and BAE Systems to provide the handheld control units for \u201cvarious aircraft and vehicle programs,\u201d according to information compiled by federal contracting software GovTribe.\u201cWith the foresight to recognize the form factor that would be most accessible to today\u2019s warfighters, [Ultra] has continued to make the FMCU one of the most highly configurable and powerful controllers available today,\u201d according to Ultra. (The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment from WIRED.)The endlessly customizable FMCU isn\u2019t totally new technology: According to Ultra, the system has been in use since at least 2010 to operate the now-sundowned Navy\u2019s MQ-8 Fire Scout unmanned autonomous helicopter and the Ground Based Operational Surveillance System (GBOSS) that the Army and Marine Corps have both employed throughout the global war on terror. But the recent proliferation of the handset across sophisticated new weapon platforms reflects a growing trend in the US military towards controls that aren\u2019t just uniquely tactile or ergonomic in their operation, but inherently familiar to the next generation of potential warfighters before they ever even sign up to serve.\u201cFor RADBO, the operators are generally a much younger audience,\u201d an Air Force spokesman tells WIRED. \u201cTherefore, utilizing a PlayStation or Xbox type of controller such as the FMCU seems to be a natural transition for the gaming generation.\u201dIndeed, that the US military is adopting specially built video-game-style controllers may appear unsurprising: The various service branches have long experimented with commercial off-the-shelf console handsets for operating novel systems. The Army and Marine Corps have for more than a decade used Xbox controllers to operate small unmanned vehicles, from ground units employed for explosive ordnance disposal to airborne drones, as well as larger assets like the M1075 Palletized Loading System logistics vehicle. Meanwhile, the \u201cphotonics mast\u201d that has replaced the traditional periscope on the Navy\u2019s new Virginia-class submarines uses the same inexpensive Xbox handset, as does the service\u2019s Multifunctional Automated Repair System robot that\u2019s employed on surface warships to address everything from in-theater battle damage repair to shipyard maintenance.This trend is also prevalent among defense industry players angling for fresh Pentagon contracts: Look no further than the LOCUST Laser Weapon System developed by BlueHalo for use as the Army\u2019s Palletized-High Energy Laser (P-HEL) system, which explicitly uses an Xbox controller to help soldiers target incoming drones and burn them out of the sky\u2014not unlike the service\u2019s previous ventures into laser weapons.\"  , \"headline\": \"This Video Game Controller Has Become the US Military\u2019s Weapon of Choice\", \"summary\": \"The US military is increasingly using video game-style controllers like the Freedom of Movement Control Unit (FMCU) to operate advanced weapons systems.

There are a lot of moving parts to it, but I think they've done pretty well.\u201dAnd so far, there\u2019s nothing else quite like it. \u201cHybrid AI\u201d used on Samsung Galaxy devices running Google Android and Google\u2019s Nano range sees some AI processes handled locally, leveraging cloud when necessary to enable more advanced capabilities.The idea is to provide as much privacy as possible while offering powerful AI functionality, says Camden Woollven, group head of AI at GRC International Group, an IT governance firm. \u201cThis means you could potentially see some pretty sophisticated AI, even on midrange smartphones.\u201dBut this type of hybrid AI processing still may pose risks because some data is sent to cloud servers without the levels of accountability that Apple offers with its PCC. \u201cWith hybrid AI, some data must leave the device and be processed elsewhere, making it more susceptible to interception or misuse,\u201d says Riccardo Ocleppo, founder and director of Open Institute of Technology, which provides technology-focused courses.Yet Google and its hardware partners argue privacy and security are a major focus of the Android AI approach. VP Justin Choi, head of the security team, mobile eXperience business at Samsung Electronics, says its hybrid AI offers users \u201ccontrol over their data and uncompromising privacy.\u201dChoi describes how features processed in the cloud are protected by servers governed by strict policies. \u201cOur on-device AI features provide another element of security by performing tasks locally on the device with no reliance on cloud servers, neither storing data on the device nor uploading it to the cloud,\u201d Choi says.Google says its data centers are designed with robust security measures, including physical security, access controls, and data encryption. When processing AI requests in the cloud, the company says, data stays within secure Google data center architecture and the firm is not sending your information to third parties.Meanwhile, Galaxy\u2019s AI engines are not trained with user data from on-device features, says Choi.

Both started with emotions. This makes sense: While such fraud happens on computers, it is at its heart about psychological manipulation. So spotting an email compromise scam requires getting in touch with how you're feeling.\\\"If an email elicits an emotional response, take a step back and reread it when you're more calm,\\\" says Ronnie Tokazowski, a security researcher who has been working to educate people about email scams for over a decade. Tokazowski emphasizes how important creating a false sense of urgency is to such scams. The stress the scam induces is what keeps you from questioning the premise. \\\"People who get pulled into these types of scams \u2026 their emotions get very deregulated,\\\" he says. That makes you less capable of thinking critically, which is a key part of how such scams work.Selena Larson, a threat researcher at cybersecurity firm Proofpoint, went a step further. \\\"I don't know if you can print this, but honestly: Just breathe,\\\" she says. \\\"Slow down, take a deep breath. That actually helps you think more clearly and rationally. Walk away from your computer or your phone and think critically. Would this be an email that someone would send me? Is this is a logical thing that I'm being asked to do?\\\"You should be particularly skeptical if the person sending the email asks you to keep something quiet.\\\"Scammers do things like isolate you from your peers,\\\" says Larson. \\\"They come at you from a position of authority and say things like, 'Please keep this confidential and only between us.' This type of social engineering makes it so people feel like they have to take an action with some kind of urgency, and that you can't share it with anybody.\\\"So this is the first step: Take control of your emotions. Yes, it can be difficult if you work in a demanding field. But it's your best first defense, and your employer will thank you for it (or, at least, they should).Now that you're skeptically questioning the legitimacy of the urgent request, check to make sure the email is coming from the person it claims to be from. The best way to do this is to ask\u2014just be careful.\\\"If you received an email like this, it's important to pick up the phone and call the number you know to be legitimate,\\\" says Larson, adding a caveat. \\\"Do not rely on a phone number in the email itself\u2014it will be owned by the threat actor.\\\"This is a crucial point: Any contact information in the email itself is likely compromised, and sometimes cleverly so. Use the phone number you've already saved in your phone for the person in question, or look up the phone number on an official website or in an official company directory. This applies even if the number in the email looks correct, because some scammers will go through the trouble of getting a phone number that's similar to that of the person they're impersonating, all on the hopes that you'll call that number instead of the real one.\\\"I've seen phone numbers off two digits from the actual phone number,\\\" says Tokazowski.Call the person who supposedly emailed you\u2014using a number you are 100 percent sure is real\u2014and confirm the request is authentic. You could also use some other secure communication channel like Slack or Microsoft Teams, or, if they're in the office, just ask them face to face. The point is to confirm any urgent request somewhere outside of the initial email. And even if the person is your boss or some other bigwig, do not worry about wasting their time.\\\"The person that is being impersonated would so much rather have someone take the time to confirm than to lose thousands or a million dollars in a malicious transaction,\\\" says Larson.Getting in touch with the supposed sender isn't always an option. If not, there are a few tricks you can use to spot whether an email is real or fake.

That's a win for Google, which has long backed RCS on Android. But what actually is RCS? And why does supporting it matter?The short version: It's an upgrade on the standard SMS/MMS texting standards that smartphones have been using from the start. It brings better support for all the cool features we're used to in our messaging apps, like read receipts and images, and it adds some extra security layers too.Yes, it's a lot like using iMessage from Apple, or using WhatsApp\u2014though it's not quite that simple. There's no RCS app you can install, but you can find apps that support the RCS standard, as we'll explain.So the long version: Rich Communication Services is a fundamental standard rather than an app like WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram. It requires carrier support to work, which is why adoption was slow in the beginning, though RCS now works across most countries and is supported by AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) weren't really built for the modern way that we communicate through our phones, and RCS tries to fix that. It adds or improves support for sharing large-resolution images and video, group chatting, read receipts, video calls, and messages that actually go beyond 160 characters.When RCS is supported in your phone's default texting app, you can add reactions to messages, see when someone else is typing, and drop extra elements like GIFs, stickers, and your current location into conversations\u2014all features you may well be used to and accept as standard in other apps.There are changes and upgrades behind the scenes as well. Whereas SMS/MMS requires a data connection to your cellular network, RCS works over cell networks as well as Wi-Fi. If you don't have a cell signal for whatever reason but you can find a wireless network, your message can still go through.The standard also brings end-to-end encryption with it. It means that no one else\u2014not even Google or your carrier\u2014can see the conversation that's taking place, because only the devices involved in the conversation have the keys necessary to decrypt it. End-to-end encryption is a security feature you should look for in any app that handles sensitive information, including communications.It's a clear upgrade, which is why Google Messages and Samsung Messages now support it\u2014the messaging apps you'll find on Pixel phones and Galaxy phones, respectively. In November 2023, Apple finally relented and agreed to support RCS on the iPhone in 2024, though this course correction perhaps had more to do with concerns about antitrust procedures than any newfound sense of camaraderie with Google.Now we know that iPhone RCS support is going to arrive in September with iOS 18. This means all of those features we've mentioned\u2014from read receipts to message reactions\u2014will work inside the iOS Messages app. However, Android users are still going to show up as green bubbles, as the RCS standard isn't going to be fully integrated with the iMessage platform that Apple operates.When you're texting someone with RCS enabled, you'll see \"  \n  , \"headline\": \"A Guide to RCS, Why Apple\u2019s Adopting It, and How It Makes Texting Better\", \"summary\": \"RCS is an upgrade to SMS/MMS texting that offers features like read receipts, larger file sharing, and end-to-end encryption.

(MSI), a subsidiary of British defense contractor Ultra that specializes in human-machine interfaces, the FMCU offers a similar form factor to the standard Xbox or PlayStation controller but with a ruggedized design intended to safeguard its sensitive electronics against whatever hostile environs American service members may find themselves in. A longtime developer of joysticks used on various US naval systems and aircraft, MSI has served as a subcontractor to major defense \u201cprimes\u201d like General Atomics, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and BAE Systems to provide the handheld control units for \u201cvarious aircraft and vehicle programs,\u201d according to information compiled by federal contracting software GovTribe.\u201cWith the foresight to recognize the form factor that would be most accessible to today\u2019s warfighters, [Ultra] has continued to make the FMCU one of the most highly configurable and powerful controllers available today,\u201d according to Ultra. (The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment from WIRED.)The endlessly customizable FMCU isn\u2019t totally new technology: According to Ultra, the system has been in use since at least 2010 to operate the now-sundowned Navy\u2019s MQ-8 Fire Scout unmanned autonomous helicopter and the Ground Based Operational Surveillance System (GBOSS) that the Army and Marine Corps have both employed throughout the global war on terror. But the recent proliferation of the handset across sophisticated new weapon platforms reflects a growing trend in the US military towards controls that aren\u2019t just uniquely tactile or ergonomic in their operation, but inherently familiar to the next generation of potential warfighters before they ever even sign up to serve.\u201cFor RADBO, the operators are generally a much younger audience,\u201d an Air Force spokesman tells WIRED. \u201cTherefore, utilizing a PlayStation or Xbox type of controller such as the FMCU seems to be a natural transition for the gaming generation.\u201dIndeed, that the US military is adopting specially built video-game-style controllers may appear unsurprising: The various service branches have long experimented with commercial off-the-shelf console handsets for operating novel systems. The Army and Marine Corps have for more than a decade used Xbox controllers to operate small unmanned vehicles, from ground units employed for explosive ordnance disposal to airborne drones, as well as larger assets like the M1075 Palletized Loading System logistics vehicle. Meanwhile, the \u201cphotonics mast\u201d that has replaced the traditional periscope on the Navy\u2019s new Virginia-class submarines uses the same inexpensive Xbox handset, as does the service\u2019s Multifunctional Automated Repair System robot that\u2019s employed on surface warships to address everything from in-theater battle damage repair to shipyard maintenance.This trend is also prevalent among defense industry players angling for fresh Pentagon contracts: Look no further than the LOCUST Laser Weapon System developed by BlueHalo for use as the Army\u2019s Palletized-High Energy Laser (P-HEL) system, which explicitly uses an Xbox controller to help soldiers target incoming drones and burn them out of the sky\u2014not unlike the service\u2019s previous ventures into laser weapons.\"  \n  , \"headline\": \"This Video Game Controller Has Become the US Military\u2019s Weapon of Choice\", \"summary\": \"The US military has increasingly adopted video-game-style controllers for operating advanced weapon systems, such as the Army's M-SHORAD and the Air Force's RADBO.

Researchers have increasingly established that there are loose, quid pro quo connections between Russian cybercriminals and the country's government. But NCA officials emphasize that Evil Corp is an unusual example of a gang that has direct relationships with multiple Russian intelligence agencies\u2014including Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB; Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR; and military intelligence agency known as the GRU. And the NCA reports that before 2019, Evil Corp was specifically \u201ctasked\u201d by Russia's intelligence services with conducting espionage operations and cyberattacks against unidentified \u201cNATO allies.\u201dFor more than a decade, Evil Corp has used its Dridex malware and other hacking tools to compromise thousands of bank accounts around the world and steal funds. In 2017, the group expanded into ransomware, using strains like Hades and PhoenixLocker, and then using the LockBit platform as an affiliate beginning in 2022. The group has extorted at least $300 million from victims on tops of its other spoils, and the United States Department of State is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to the arrest of the gang's alleged leader, Maksim Yakubets.\u201cEvil Corp\u2019s story is a prime example of the evolving threat posed by cybercriminals and ransomware operators,\u201d the NCA wrote on Tuesday in a joint report with the FBI and Australian Federal Police. \u201cIn their case, the activities of the Russian state played a particularly significant role, sometimes even co-opting this cybercrime group for its own malicious cyber activity.\u201dUnlike many Russian cybercrime groups that have evolved a distributed leadership structure online, NCA officials say that Evil Corp is organized like a more traditional crime syndicate around Yakubets' family and friends. His father, Viktor Yakubets, allegedly has a background in money laundering, and Maksim's brother Artem, along with cousins Kirill and Dmitry Slobodskoy, are all allegedly involved with the group. Officials also allege that the group has operated out of physical locations, including Chianti Caf\u00e9 and Scenario Caf\u00e9 in Moscow.Officials say that Maksim Yakubets has always been the primary liaison between Evil Corp and Russian intelligence. But other members, including his father-in-law, Eduard Benderskiy, also allegedly contribute to the relationships. Benderskiy is reportedly a former FSB official who worked in the mysterious \u2018Vympel\u2019 unit and, according to Bellingcat, may have been involved in a series of overseas assassinations. NCA officials say that after the US's 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp members, Benderskiy worked to protect the gang's senior members within Russia.In spite of its longtime dominance, Evil Corp has had to continue evolving to keep making money. While it denies a relationship, the group seemed to have used the notorious ransomware-as-a-service platform LockBit to conduct attacks since 2022. And Yakubets\u2019 alleged second in command, whom NCA officials named on Tuesday as Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, was apparently overseeing this work.

The scheme is mature enough that there are now readily available prefab cryptocurrency investment platforms, templates, and scripts available for sale online to anyone who wants to get started. A gang that is already used to carrying out romance scams or business email compromise schemes could easily adapt to the premise and cadence of pig butchering.\u201cIf you look at West Africa\u2019s history with social engineering stuff, it\u2019s a potent mix,\u201d says Sean Gallagher, principal threat researcher at Sophos. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of people who have seen this as a way to make a living, especially in Nigeria. And the technology is easily transferable. We\u2019ve seen pig butchering packages for sale that include fake crypto sites and scripts that appear to be tailored to targeting African victims.\u201dNigerian law enforcement have been increasingly pursuing cases and even securing convictions related specifically to pig butchering. Gallagher and Intelligence for Good\u2019s Tokazowski also say that in studying and interacting with scammers, they have seen technical indicators that pig butchering attacks may be coming out of Ghana as well. The US Embassy in Ghana has warned about the potential for financial scams originating in the country.Pig butchering has cropped up in other regions of Africa as well, with ties to Chinese-speaking criminals. In June, 88 people in Namibia were rescued from a scam center, which had links to Chinese nationals who were reportedly arrested. Meanwhile, local reports also indicated that 22 Chinese nationals were sentenced to jail time in Zambia for their links to local scam centers.Stephanie Baroud, a criminal intelligence analyst in Interpol\u2019s human trafficking unit, says the policing organization, which has been coordinating law enforcement actions, has seen an increase in international scam centers. Not all of them are linked to criminal groups from Asia.\u201cWhile sometimes we are noting a link to Asian groups, there are cases where there haven't been,\u201d Baroud says. In some situations, she says, new pig butchering activity around the world seems to be an offshoot of Southeast Asian operations, but unrelated actors appear to be taking the model and adapting it to their resources and expertise.The scams have emerged in Eastern Europe as well. At least two \u201cfraudulent call centers\u201d trying to con people into investing in cryptocurrency were uncovered by law enforcement in Georgia this month, with reports saying men from Taiwan were forced into working in the country. Local officials, who did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment, have said in recent years they have prosecuted seven companies involved in call center operations.Scam compounds have also been broken up in Peru and Sri Lanka. And there has even been alleged trafficking in truly unexpected places like the Isle of Man, a British territory where almost 100 people were working between 2022 and 2023 as part of a pig butchering operation, according to a BBC investigation from August.\u201cThe People\u2019s Republic of China\u2013origin criminal groups that are behind these sophisticated forms of scamming are looking to build networks and hubs all around the globe simply because this is so lucrative,\u201d says Jason Tower, the country director for Burma and a long-time security analyst covering China and Southeast Asia at the United States Institute of Peace.Pig butchering scam centers rely upon multiple layers of criminality to operate, encompassing the recruitment of trafficked people, running scam centers on a day-to-day basis, the development of technology to scam thousands of people, and the sophisticated money laundering required to process billions of dollars. As Chinese authorities have cracked down on Chinese-speaking criminal organizations operating scam centers across Southeast Asia, the groups have likely continued to spread their operations, albeit at a smaller scale.\u201cI would say it was an intentional hedging strategy, seemingly to diversify the geographic basis of operation and ultimately ensure business continuity,\u201d says John Wojcik, an organized crime analyst at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. \u201cBut at the same time, I think it\u2019s also an immediate reaction to mounting law enforcement pressure and regulatory tightening in this region.\u201dIn addition to the geographic spread of pig butchering operations, researchers note that there has also been a shift in the people targeted by traffickers to \u201cwork\u201d in scam compounds. \u201cOver the past two years, the countries targeted for recruitment have gradually shifted westward,\u201d says Eric Heintz, a global analyst at human rights organization International Justice Mission.Many trafficking victims within the early years of pig butchering were based in Southeast Asian countries, but this soon shifted to South Asian nations such as India and Nepal, Heintz says. \u201cWe have since seen recruitment posts targeting East African nations like Kenya and Uganda, and then West African countries like Morocco, and then, most recently, we have seen posts targeting El Salvador.\u201dAs always, the spread and evolution of pig butchering is driven by how profitable it can be. Researchers say that another alarming trend involves people from around the world choosing to go work in scam centers or even being liberated from forced labor and returning to keep working voluntarily. As long as the money keeps coming in, pig butchering will keep spreading around the world.\u201cFraud is not being seen as a serious crime\u2014not like drugs, not like terrorism,\u201d Humanity Research Consultancy\u2019s Chiang says. \u201cGlobally, we need to start shifting that idea, because it creates the same kind of damage, and maybe even more because the amount of money we're talking about is so huge.

The recommendations, which will be mandatory for US federal government entities and serve as guidelines for everyone else, ban the practice of requiring users to periodically change their account passwords, often every 90 days.The policy of regularly changing passwords evolved out of a desire to ensure that people weren't choosing easily guessable or reused passwords; but in practice, it causes people to choose simple or formulaic passwords so they will be easier to keep track of. The new recommendations also ban \u201ccomposition rules,\u201d like requiring a certain number or mix of capital letters, numbers, and punctuation marks in each password. NIST writes in the draft that the goal of the Digital Identity Guidelines is to provide \u201cfoundational risk management processes and requirements that enable the implementation of secure, private, equitable, and accessible identity systems.\u201dDOJ Indicts Alleged Iranian Hackers Over Trump Campaign BreachThe US Department of Justice unsealed charges on Friday against three Iranian men who allegedly compromised Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and leaked stolen data to media outlets.

(MSI), a subsidiary of British defense contractor Ultra that specializes in human-machine interfaces, the FMCU offers a similar form factor to the standard Xbox or PlayStation controller but with a ruggedized design intended to safeguard its sensitive electronics against whatever hostile environs American service members may find themselves in. A longtime developer of joysticks used on various US naval systems and aircraft, MSI has served as a subcontractor to major defense \u201cprimes\u201d like General Atomics, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and BAE Systems to provide the handheld control units for \u201cvarious aircraft and vehicle programs,\u201d according to information compiled by federal contracting software GovTribe.\u201cWith the foresight to recognize the form factor that would be most accessible to today\u2019s warfighters, [Ultra] has continued to make the FMCU one of the most highly configurable and powerful controllers available today,\u201d according to Ultra. (The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment from WIRED.)The endlessly customizable FMCU isn\u2019t totally new technology: According to Ultra, the system has been in use since at least 2010 to operate the now-sundowned Navy\u2019s MQ-8 Fire Scout unmanned autonomous helicopter and the Ground Based Operational Surveillance System (GBOSS) that the Army and Marine Corps have both employed throughout the global war on terror. But the recent proliferation of the handset across sophisticated new weapon platforms reflects a growing trend in the US military towards controls that aren\u2019t just uniquely tactile or ergonomic in their operation, but inherently familiar to the next generation of potential warfighters before they ever even sign up to serve.\u201cFor RADBO, the operators are generally a much younger audience,\u201d an Air Force spokesman tells WIRED. \u201cTherefore, utilizing a PlayStation or Xbox type of controller such as the FMCU seems to be a natural transition for the gaming generation.\u201dIndeed, that the US military is adopting specially built video-game-style controllers may appear unsurprising: The various service branches have long experimented with commercial off-the-shelf console handsets for operating novel systems. The Army and Marine Corps have for more than a decade used Xbox controllers to operate small unmanned vehicles, from ground units employed for explosive ordnance disposal to airborne drones, as well as larger assets like the M1075 Palletized Loading System logistics vehicle. Meanwhile, the \u201cphotonics mast\u201d that has replaced the traditional periscope on the Navy\u2019s new Virginia-class submarines uses the same inexpensive Xbox handset, as does the service\u2019s Multifunctional Automated Repair System robot that\u2019s employed on surface warships to address everything from in-theater battle damage repair to shipyard maintenance.This trend is also prevalent among defense industry players angling for fresh Pentagon contracts: Look no further than the LOCUST Laser Weapon System developed by BlueHalo for use as the Army\u2019s Palletized-High Energy Laser (P-HEL) system, which explicitly uses an Xbox controller to help soldiers target incoming drones and burn them out of the sky\u2014not unlike the service\u2019s previous ventures into laser weapons.\u201cBy 2006, games like Halo were dominant in the military,\"  ,  \"headline\": \"This Video Game Controller Has Become the US Military\u2019s Weapon of Choice\", \"summary\": \"The US military is adopting video game controllers to operate its newest weapons systems like the Army\u2019s new Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) system, the Air Force\u2019s Recovery of Air Bases Denied by Ordnance (RADBO) truck, and the Marine Corps' High Energy Laser-Expeditionary (HELEX) laser weapon system.\", \"date\": \"Oct 4, 2024\"}, {\"description\": \"International law enforcement has worked for years to disrupt the cybercriminal gang Evil Corp and its egregious global crime spree.

Researchers have increasingly established that there are loose, quid pro quo connections between Russian cybercriminals and the country's government. But NCA officials emphasize that Evil Corp is an unusual example of a gang that has direct relationships with multiple Russian intelligence agencies\u2014including Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB; Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR; and military intelligence agency known as the GRU.

In 2017, the group expanded into ransomware, using strains like Hades and PhoenixLocker, and then using the LockBit platform as an affiliate beginning in 2022.

It gets installed by exploiting more than 20,000 common misconfigurations, a capability that may make millions of machines connected to the internet potential targets, researchers from Aqua Security said. It can also exploit CVE-2023-33426, a vulnerability with a severity rating of 10 out of 10 that was patched last year in Apache RocketMQ, a messaging and streaming platform that\u2019s found on many Linux machines.Perfctl StormThe researchers are calling the malware Perfctl, the name of a malicious component that surreptitiously mines cryptocurrency. The unknown developers of the malware gave the process a name that combines the perf Linux monitoring tool and ctl, an abbreviation commonly used with command line tools. A signature characteristic of Perfctl is its use of process and file names that are identical or similar to those commonly found in Linux environments. The naming convention is one of the many ways the malware attempts to escape notice of infected users.Perfctl further cloaks itself using a host of other tricks. One is that it installs many of its components as rootkits, a special class of malware that hides its presence from the operating system and administrative tools. Other stealth mechanisms include:Stopping activities that are easy to detect when a new user logs inUsing a Unix socket over TOR for external communicationsDeleting its installation binary after execution and running as a background service thereafterManipulating the Linux process pcap_loop through a technique known as hooking to prevent admin tools from recording the malicious trafficSuppressing mesg errors to avoid any visible warnings during execution.The malware is designed to ensure persistence, meaning the ability to remain on the infected machine after reboots or attempts to delete core components. Two such techniques are (1) modifying the ~/.profile script, which sets up the environment during user login so the malware loads ahead of legitimate workloads expected to run on the server and (2) copying itself from memory to multiple disk locations. The hooking of pcap_loop can also provide persistence by allowing malicious activities to continue even after primary payloads are detected and removed.Besides using the machine resources to mine cryptocurrency, Perfctl also turns the machine into a profit-making proxy that paying customers use to relay their internet traffic. Aqua Security researchers have also observed the malware serving as a backdoor to install other families of malware.Assaf Morag, Aqua Security\u2019s threat intelligence director, wrote in an email:Perfctl malware stands out as a significant threat due to its design, which enables it to evade detection while maintaining persistence on infected systems. This combination poses a challenge for defenders and indeed the malware has been linked to a growing number of reports and discussions across various forums, highlighting the distress and frustration of users who find themselves infected.Perfctl uses a rootkit and changes some of the system utilities to hide the activity of the cryptominer and proxy-jacking software. It blends seamlessly into its environment with seemingly legitimate names. Additionally, Perfctl\u2019s architecture enables it to perform a range of malicious activities, from data exfiltration to the deployment of additional payloads. Its versatility means that it can be leveraged for various malicious purposes, making it particularly dangerous for organizations and individuals alike.\u201cThe Malware Always Manages to Restart\u201dWhile Perfctl and some of the malware it installs are detected by some antivirus software, Aqua Security researchers were unable to find any research reports on the malware. They were, however, able to find a wealth of threads on developer-related sites that discussed infections consistent with it.This Reddit comment posted to the CentOS subreddit is typical. An admin noticed that two servers were infected with a cryptocurrency hijacker with the names perfcc and perfctl.

Researchers have increasingly established that there are loose, quid pro quo connections between Russian cybercriminals and the country's government. But NCA officials emphasize that Evil Corp is an unusual example of a gang that has direct relationships with multiple Russian intelligence agencies\u2014including Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB; Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR; and military intelligence agency known as the GRU. And the NCA reports that before 2019, Evil Corp was specifically \u201ctasked\u201d by Russia's intelligence services with conducting espionage operations and cyberattacks against unidentified \u201cNATO allies.\u201d For more than a decade, Evil Corp has used its Dridex malware and other hacking tools to compromise thousands of bank accounts around the world and steal funds. In 2017, the group expanded into ransomware, using strains like Hades and PhoenixLocker, and then using the LockBit platform as an affiliate beginning in 2022. The group has extorted at least $300 million from victims on tops of its other spoils, and the United States Department of State is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to the arrest of the gang's alleged leader, Maksim Yakubets. \u201cEvil Corp\u2019s story is a prime example of the evolving threat posed by cybercriminals and ransomware operators,\u201d the NCA wrote on Tuesday in a joint report with the FBI and Australian Federal Police. \u201cIn their case, the activities of the Russian state played a particularly significant role, sometimes even co-opting this cybercrime group for its own malicious cyber activity.\u201d Unlike many Russian cybercrime groups that have evolved a distributed leadership structure online, NCA officials say that Evil Corp is organized like a more traditional crime syndicate around Yakubets' family and friends. His father, Viktor Yakubets, allegedly has a background in money laundering, and Maksim's brother Artem, along with cousins Kirill and Dmitry Slobodskoy, are all allegedly involved with the group. Officials also allege that the group has operated out of physical locations, including Chianti Caf\u00e9 and Scenario Caf\u00e9 in Moscow. Officials say that Maksim Yakubets has always been the primary liaison between Evil Corp and Russian intelligence. But other members, including his father-in-law, Eduard Benderskiy, also allegedly contribute to the relationships. Benderskiy is reportedly a former FSB official who worked in the mysterious \u2018Vympel\u2019 unit and, according to Bellingcat, may have been involved in a series of overseas assassinations. NCA officials say that after the US's 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp members, Benderskiy worked to protect the gang's senior members within Russia. In spite of its longtime dominance, Evil Corp has had to continue evolving to keep making money. While it denies a relationship, the group seemed to have used the notorious ransomware-as-a-service platform LockBit to conduct attacks since 2022. And Yakubets\u2019 alleged second in command, whom NCA officials named on Tuesday as Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, was apparently overseeing this work. After international law enforcement launched a major disruption of LockBit in February, the gang has been operating in a diminished capacity, according to the NCA. \u201cBorn out of a coalescing of elite cybercriminals, Evil Corp\u2019s sophisticated business model made them one of the most pervasive and persistent cybercrime adversaries to date,\u201d the NCA wrote. \u201cAfter being hampered by the December 2019 sanctions and indictments, the group have been forced to diversify their tactics as they attempt to continue causing harm whilst adapting to the changing cybercrime ecosystem.\u201d\", \"headline\": \"Notorious Evil Corp Hackers Targeted NATO Allies for Russian Intelligence\", \"summary\": \"The UK's National Crime Agency released new details about the cybercriminal gang Evil Corp, including its use of the Lockbit ransomware platform and ties to Russian intelligence.

Such \u201cpig butchering\u201d operations have largely been concentrated in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, typically rooted in Chinese organized crime groups exploiting instability and poor governance in the region. Though they come at great humanitarian cost, pig butchering scams are undeniably lucrative and, perhaps inevitably, similar operations are now being uncovered on multiple continents and in numerous countries around the world. A WIRED review of law enforcement and civil society action as well as interviews with numerous researchers show that pig butchering operations that are offshoots of the Southeast Asian activity have emerged in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and West Africa. Many of these expanded operations apparently have links to Chinese-speaking criminals or have evolved in parallel to Chinese Belt and Road Initiative investments, the country\u2019s massive international infrastructure and development initiative. In 2023, the FBI had reports of nearly $4 billion in losses from the scams, and some researchers put all-time total global losses at $75 billion or more. Beijing has made a concerted effort in recent months to crack down on pig butchering schemes and human trafficking to scamming centers in the Southeast Asian region, but the activity is proliferating around the world nonetheless. \u201cAs all sorts of attackers learn that they can make serious money doing this, they\u2019re going to make those pivots,\u201d says Ronnie Tokazowski, a longtime pig butchering researcher and cofounder of the nonprofit Intelligence for Good. \u201cSo pig butchering is cropping up in more and more countries. Even with all the interventions researchers and law enforcement have done there is little to no sign of this stopping.\u201d Pig butchering emerged in the last five years and is a type of scam that involves building seemingly intimate relationships with victims. Attacks often start by texting potential targets out of the blue and getting them talking. Then attackers begin to build a rapport and introduce the idea of a special or unique investment opportunity. Finally, victims send funds\u2014typically cryptocurrency\u2014through a malicious platform meant to look like a legitimate money management service, and attackers must launder the money from there. All of this takes time and careful planning from a large workforce. Experts say people from more than 60 countries have been abducted and trafficked to Southeast Asian scamming compounds that typically operate with thousands of forced workers. And in recent months, scam centers have been detected around the world as well in different configurations and sizes, but with the same goal. \u201cOrganized crime groups have basically taken advantage of a favorable situation, a favorable environment for them related to governance challenges, limited enforcement capacities, limited regulations and legislative frameworks,\u201d says Benedikt Hofmann, the deputy head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\u2019s Southeast Asia and Pacific office. \u201cAll these ingredients you also find in some other places of the world.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is criminal groups who are invested in this region here, looking beyond this region for establishing similar operations,\u201d Hofmann says of the international expansion. The wealthy, authoritarian city of Dubai, within the United Arab Emirates, has emerged since 2021 as the largest epicenter of pig butchering outside Southeast Asia. According to the UN, international migrants comprise more than 88 percent of the UAE\u2019s population, making a uniquely diverse, and potentially vulnerable, workforce readily available. \u201cDubai is both a destination and also a transition country,\u201d says Mina Chiang, the founder and director of Humanity Research Consultancy, a social enterprise focusing on human trafficking. \u201cWe can see lots of compounds that are actually operating in Dubai itself.\u201d In July, Humanity Research Consultancy identified at least six alleged scam compounds believed to be operating around Dubai. The research\u2014based on testimony from forced laborers, data leaked from a cyberattack, and social media posts\u2014identified potential compounds around industrial and investment parks. These operations \u201cto the best of our knowledge are managed by Chinese-speaking criminals,\u201d the research says, adding that they operate in a similar way to compounds in Southeast Asia. \u201cThey call it a typing center. But a huge scam call center,\u201d reads a one-star review left for a location in Dubai on Google Maps. Another says: \u201cMostly poor people from Africa working there and mosltly jailed in Dubai. No matter how much they offer you everything is scammed. Highly suggest never ever go there.\u201d Dubai\u2019s police force did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment about potential scam centers located in the city. Pig butchering operations may have emerged in Dubai because of immigration and workforce dynamics, but in multiple African countries the activity has started to appear because of an existing culture of organized scamming. In Nigeria, where digital scamming has been a prominent illicit industry for years across numerous platforms, it was all but inevitable that attackers would adopt the conceits and tactics of pig butchering. The scheme is mature enough that there are now readily available prefab cryptocurrency investment platforms, templates, and scripts available for sale online to anyone who wants to get started. A gang that is already used to carrying out romance scams or business email compromise schemes could easily adapt to the premise and cadence of pig butchering. \u201cIf you look at West Africa\u2019s history with social engineering stuff, it\u2019s a potent mix,\u201d says Sean Gallagher, principal threat researcher at Sophos. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of people who have seen this as a way to make a living, especially in Nigeria.

It can also exploit CVE-2023-33426, a vulnerability with a severity rating of 10 out of 10 that was patched last year in Apache RocketMQ, a messaging and streaming platform that\u2019s found on many Linux machines. Perfctl Storm The researchers are calling the malware Perfctl, the name of a malicious component that surreptitiously mines cryptocurrency. The unknown developers of the malware gave the process a name that combines the perf Linux monitoring tool and ctl, an abbreviation commonly used with command line tools. A signature characteristic of Perfctl is its use of process and file names that are identical or similar to those commonly found in Linux environments. The naming convention is one of the many ways the malware attempts to escape notice of infected users. Perfctl further cloaks itself using a host of other tricks. One is that it installs many of its components as rootkits, a special class of malware that hides its presence from the operating system and administrative tools. Other stealth mechanisms include: Stopping activities that are easy to detect when a new user logs in Using a Unix socket over TOR for external communications Deleting its installation binary after execution and running as a background service thereafter Manipulating the Linux process pcap_loop through a technique known as hooking to prevent admin tools from recording the malicious traffic Suppressing mesg errors to avoid any visible warnings during execution. The malware is designed to ensure persistence, meaning the ability to remain on the infected machine after reboots or attempts to delete core components. Two such techniques are (1) modifying the ~/.profile script, which sets up the environment during user login so the malware loads ahead of legitimate workloads expected to run on the server and (2) copying itself from memory to multiple disk locations. The hooking of pcap_loop can also provide persistence by allowing malicious activities to continue even after primary payloads are detected and removed. Besides using the machine resources to mine cryptocurrency, Perfctl also turns the machine into a profit-making proxy that paying customers use to relay their internet traffic. Aqua Security researchers have also observed the malware serving as a backdoor to install other families of malware. Assaf Morag, Aqua Security\u2019s threat intelligence director, wrote in an email: Perfctl malware stands out as a significant threat due to its design, which enables it to evade detection while maintaining persistence on infected systems. This combination poses a challenge for defenders and indeed the malware has been linked to a growing number of reports and discussions across various forums, highlighting the distress and frustration of users who find themselves infected. Perfctl uses a rootkit and changes some of the system utilities to hide the activity of the cryptominer and proxy-jacking software. It blends seamlessly into its environment with seemingly legitimate names. Additionally, Perfctl\u2019s architecture enables it to perform a range of malicious activities, from data exfiltration to the deployment of additional payloads.

Such \u201cpig butchering\u201d operations have largely been concentrated in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, typically rooted in Chinese organized crime groups exploiting instability and poor governance in the region. Though they come at great humanitarian cost, pig butchering scams are undeniably lucrative and, perhaps inevitably, similar operations are now being uncovered on multiple continents and in numerous countries around the world.A WIRED review of law enforcement and civil society action as well as interviews with numerous researchers show that pig butchering operations that are offshoots of the Southeast Asian activity have emerged in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and West Africa. Many of these expanded operations apparently have links to Chinese-speaking criminals or have evolved in parallel to Chinese Belt and Road Initiative investments, the country\u2019s massive international infrastructure and development initiative.In 2023, the FBI had reports of nearly $4 billion in losses from the scams, and some researchers put all-time total global losses at $75 billion or more. Beijing has made a concerted effort in recent months to crack down on pig butchering schemes and human trafficking to scamming centers in the Southeast Asian region, but the activity is proliferating around the world nonetheless.\u201cAs all sorts of attackers learn that they can make serious money doing this, they\u2019re going to make those pivots,\u201d says Ronnie Tokazowski, a longtime pig butchering researcher and cofounder of the nonprofit Intelligence for Good. \u201cSo pig butchering is cropping up in more and more countries. Even with all the interventions researchers and law enforcement have done there is little to no sign of this stopping.\u201dPig butchering emerged in the last five years and is a type of scam that involves building seemingly intimate relationships with victims. Attacks often start by texting potential targets out of the blue and getting them talking. Then attackers begin to build a rapport and introduce the idea of a special or unique investment opportunity. Finally, victims send funds\u2014typically cryptocurrency\u2014through a malicious platform meant to look like a legitimate money management service, and attackers must launder the money from there. All of this takes time and careful planning from a large workforce. Experts say people from more than 60 countries have been abducted and trafficked to Southeast Asian scamming compounds that typically operate with thousands of forced workers. And in recent months, scam centers have been detected around the world as well in different configurations and sizes, but with the same goal.\u201cOrganized crime groups have basically taken advantage of a favorable situation, a favorable environment for them related to governance challenges, limited enforcement capacities, limited regulations and legislative frameworks,\u201d says Benedikt Hofmann, the deputy head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\u2019s Southeast Asia and Pacific office. \u201cAll these ingredients you also find in some other places of the world.\u201d\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is criminal groups who are invested in this region here, looking beyond this region for establishing similar operations,\u201d Hofmann says of the international expansion.The wealthy, authoritarian city of Dubai, within the United Arab Emirates, has emerged since 2021 as the largest epicenter of pig butchering outside Southeast Asia. According to the UN, international migrants comprise more than 88 percent of the UAE\u2019s population, making a uniquely diverse, and potentially vulnerable, workforce readily available.\u201cDubai is both a destination and also a transition country,\u201d says Mina Chiang, the founder and director of Humanity Research Consultancy, a social enterprise focusing on human trafficking. \u201cWe can see lots of compounds that are actually operating in Dubai itself.\u201dIn July, Humanity Research Consultancy identified at least six alleged scam compounds believed to be operating around Dubai. The research\u2014based on testimony from forced laborers, data leaked from a cyberattack, and social media posts\u2014identified potential compounds around industrial and investment parks. These operations \u201cto the best of our knowledge are managed by Chinese-speaking criminals,\u201d the research says, adding that they operate in a similar way to compounds in Southeast Asia.\u201cThey call it a typing center. But a huge scam call center,\u201d reads a one-star review left for a location in Dubai on Google Maps. Another says: \u201cMostly poor people from Africa working there and mosltly jailed in Dubai. No matter how much they offer you everything is scammed. Highly suggest never ever go there.\u201dDubai\u2019s police force did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment about potential scam centers located in the city.Pig butchering operations may have emerged in Dubai because of immigration and workforce dynamics, but in multiple African countries the activity has started to appear because of an existing culture of organized scamming.In Nigeria, where digital scamming has been a prominent illicit industry for years across numerous platforms, it was all but inevitable that attackers would adopt the conceits and tactics of pig butchering. The scheme is mature enough that there are now readily available prefab cryptocurrency investment platforms, templates, and scripts available for sale online to anyone who wants to get started. A gang that is already used to carrying out romance scams or business email compromise schemes could easily adapt to the premise and cadence of pig butchering.\u201cIf you look at West Africa\u2019s history with social engineering stuff, it\u2019s a potent mix,\u201d says Sean Gallagher, principal threat researcher at Sophos. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of people who have seen this as a way to make a living, especially in Nigeria. And the technology is easily transferable. We\u2019ve seen pig butchering packages for sale that include fake crypto sites and scripts that appear to be tailored to targeting African victims.\u201dNigerian law enforcement have been increasingly pursuing cases and even securing convictions related specifically to pig butchering. Gallagher and Intelligence for Good\u2019s Tokazowski also say that in studying and interacting with scammers, they have seen technical indicators that pig butchering attacks may be coming out of Ghana as well. The US Embassy in Ghana has warned about the potential for financial scams originating in the country.Pig butchering has cropped up in other regions of Africa as well, with ties to Chinese-speaking criminals. In June, 88 people in Namibia were rescued from a scam center, which had links to Chinese nationals who were reportedly arrested. Meanwhile, local reports also indicated that 22 Chinese nationals were sentenced to jail time in Zambia for their links to local scam centers.Stephanie Baroud, a criminal intelligence analyst in Interpol\u2019s human trafficking unit, says the policing organization, which has been coordinating law enforcement actions, has seen an increase in international scam centers. Not all of them are linked to criminal groups from Asia.\u201cWhile sometimes we are noting a link to Asian groups, there are cases where there haven't been,\u201d Baroud says. In some situations, she says, new pig butchering activity around the world seems to be an offshoot of Southeast Asian operations, but unrelated actors appear to be taking the model and adapting it to their resources and expertise.The scams have emerged in Eastern Europe as well. At least two \u201cfraudulent call centers\u201d trying to con people into investing in cryptocurrency were uncovered by law enforcement in Georgia this month, with reports saying men from Taiwan were forced into working in the country. Local officials, who did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment, have said in recent years they have prosecuted seven companies involved in call center operations.Scam compounds have also been broken up in Peru and Sri Lanka. And there has even been alleged trafficking in truly unexpected places like the Isle of Man, a British territory where almost 100 people were working between 2022 and 2023 as part of a pig butchering operation, according to a BBC investigation from August.\u201cThe People\u2019s Republic of China\u2013origin criminal groups that are behind these sophisticated forms of scamming are looking to build networks and hubs all around the globe simply because this is so lucrative,\u201d says Jason Tower, the country director for Burma and a long-time security analyst covering China and Southeast Asia at the United States Institute of Peace.Pig butchering scam centers rely upon multiple layers of criminality to operate, encompassing the recruitment of trafficked people, running scam centers on a day-to-day basis, the development of technology to scam thousands of people, and the sophisticated money laundering required to process billions of dollars. As Chinese authorities have cracked down on Chinese-speaking criminal organizations operating scam centers across Southeast Asia, the groups have likely continued to spread their operations, albeit at a smaller scale.\u201cI would say it was an intentional hedging strategy, seemingly to diversify the geographic basis of operation and ultimately ensure business continuity,\u201d says John Wojcik, an organized crime analyst at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. \u201cBut at the same time, I think it\u2019s also an immediate reaction to mounting law enforcement pressure and regulatory tightening in this region.\u201dIn addition to the geographic spread of pig butchering operations, researchers note that there has also been a shift in the people targeted by traffickers to \u201cwork\u201d in scam compounds. \u201cOver the past two years, the countries targeted for recruitment have gradually shifted westward,\u201d says Eric Heintz, a global analyst at human rights organization International Justice Mission.Many trafficking victims within the early years of pig butchering were based in Southeast Asian countries, but this soon shifted to South Asian nations such as India and Nepal, Heintz says. \u201cWe have since seen recruitment posts targeting East African nations like Kenya and Uganda, and then West African countries like Morocco, and then, most recently, we have seen posts targeting El Salvador.\u201dAs always, the spread and evolution of pig butchering is driven by how profitable it can be. Researchers say that another alarming trend involves people from around the world choosing to go work in scam centers or even being liberated from forced labor and returning to keep working voluntarily. As long as the money keeps coming in, pig butchering will keep spreading around the world.\u201cFraud is not being seen as a serious crime\u2014not like drugs, not like terrorism,\u201d Humanity Research Consultancy\u2019s Chiang says. \u201cGlobally, we need to start shifting that idea, because it creates the same kind of damage, and maybe even more because the amount of money we're talking about is so huge. We are racing against time.\u201d\", \"headline\": \"The Pig Butchering Invasion Has Begun\", \"summary\": \"Pig Butchering scams, which originated in Southeast Asia, are now spreading globally, with operations in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America and West Africa.

Perfctl uses a rootkit and changes some of the system utilities to hide the activity of the cryptominer and proxy-jacking software. It blends seamlessly into its environment with seemingly legitimate names. Additionally, Perfctl\u2019s architecture enables it to perform a range of malicious activities, from data exfiltration to the deployment of additional payloads. Its versatility means that it can be leveraged for various malicious purposes, making it particularly dangerous for organizations and individuals alike.\u201cThe Malware Always Manages to Restart\u201d While Perfctl and some of the malware it installs are detected by some antivirus software, Aqua Security researchers were unable to find any research reports on the malware. They were, however, able to find a wealth of threads on developer-related sites that discussed infections consistent with it. This Reddit comment posted to the CentOS subreddit is typical. An admin noticed that two servers were infected with a cryptocurrency hijacker with the names perfcc and perfctl. The admin wanted help investigating the cause. \u201cI only became aware of the malware because my monitoring setup alerted me to 100% CPU utilization,\u201d the admin wrote in the April 2023 post. \u201cHowever, the process would stop immediately when I logged in via SSH or console. As soon as I logged out, the malware would resume running within a few seconds or minutes.\u201d The admin continued: I have attempted to remove the malware by following the steps outlined in other forums, but to no avail. The malware always manages to restart once I log out. I have also searched the entire system for the string \u201cperfcc\u201d and found the files listed below. However, removing them did not resolve the issue. as it keep respawn on each time rebooted. Other discussions include: Reddit, Stack Overflow (Spanish), forobeta (Spanish), brainycp (Russian), natnetwork (Indonesian), Proxmox (Deutsch), Camel2243 (Chinese), svrforum (Korean), exabytes, virtualmin, serverfault and many others. After exploiting a vulnerability or misconfiguration, the exploit code downloads the main payload from a server, which, in most cases, has been hacked by the attacker and converted into a channel for distributing the malware anonymously. An attack that targeted the researchers\u2019 honeypot named the payload httpd. Once executed, the file copies itself from memory to a new location in the /temp directory, runs it, and then terminates the original process and deletes the downloaded binary. Once moved to the /tmp directory, the file executes under a different name, which mimics the name of a known Linux process. The file hosted on the honeypot was named sh. From there, the file establishes a local command-and-control process and attempts to gain root system rights by exploiting CVE-2021-4043, a privilege-escalation vulnerability that was patched in 2021 in Gpac, a widely used open source multimedia framework. The malware goes on to copy itself from memory to a handful of other disk locations, once again using names that appear as routine system files. The malware then drops a rootkit, a host of popular Linux utilities that have been modified to serve as rootkits, and the miner. In some cases, the malware also installs software for \u201cproxy-jacking,\u201d the term for surreptitiously routing traffic through the infected machine so the true origin of the data isn\u2019t revealed. The researchers continued: As part of its command-and-control operation, the malware opens a Unix socket, creates two directories under the /tmp directory, and stores data there that influences its operation. This data includes host events, locations of the copies of itself, process names, communication logs, tokens, and additional log information. Additionally, the malware uses environment variables to store data that further affects its execution and behavior. All the binaries are packed, stripped, and encrypted, indicating significant efforts to bypass defense mechanisms and hinder reverse engineering attempts. The malware also uses advanced evasion techniques, such as suspending its activity when it detects a new user in the btmp or utmp files and terminating any competing malware to maintain control over the infected system. By extrapolating data such as the number of Linux servers connected to the internet across various services and applications, as tracked by services such as Shodan and Censys, the researchers estimate that the number of machines infected by Perfctl is measured in the thousands. They say that the pool of vulnerable machines\u2014meaning those that have yet to install the patch for CVE-2023-33426 or contain a vulnerable misconfiguration\u2014is in the millions. The researchers have yet to measure the amount of cryptocurrency the malicious miners have generated. People who want to determine if their device has been targeted or infected by Perfctl should look for indicators of compromise included in Thursday\u2019s post. They should also be on the lookout for unusual spikes in CPU usage or sudden system slowdowns, particularly if they occur during idle times. Thursday\u2019s report also provides steps for preventing infections in the first place.\", \"headline\": \"Stealthy Malware Has Infected Thousands of Linux Systems for Years\", \"summary\": \"A new malware strain called Perfctl has been silently infecting Linux systems since 2021, exploiting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations to steal cryptocurrency and act as a proxy for malicious traffic.
