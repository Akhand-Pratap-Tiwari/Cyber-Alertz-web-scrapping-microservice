[{"description": "Threat actors are attempting to abuse the open-source EDRSilencer tool as part of efforts to tamper endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and hide malicious activity. Trend Micro said it detected \"threat actors attempting to integrate EDRSilencer in their attacks, repurposing it as a means of evading detection.\" EDRSilencer, inspired by the NightHawk FireBlock tool from MDSec, is designed to block outbound traffic of running EDR processes using the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP). It supports terminating various processes related to EDR products from Microsoft, Elastic, Trellix, Qualys, SentinelOne, Cybereason, Broadcom Carbon Black, Tanium, Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Cisco, ESET, HarfangLab, and Trend Micro. By incorporating such legitimate red teaming tools into their arsenal, the goal is to render EDR software ineffective and make it a lot more challenging to identify and remove malware. \"The WFP is a powerful framework built into Windows for creating network filtering and security applications,\" Trend Micro researchers said. \"It provides APIs for developers to define custom rules to monitor, block, or modify network traffic based on various criteria, such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, and applications.\" \"WFP is used in firewalls, antivirus software, and other security solutions to protect systems and networks.\" EDRSilencer takes advantage of WFP by dynamically identifying running EDR processes and creating persistent WFP filters to block their outbound network communications on both IPv4 and IPv6, thereby preventing security software from sending telemetry to their management consoles. The attack essentially works by scanning the system to gather a list of running processes associated with common EDR products, followed by running EDRSilencer with the argument \"blockedr\" (e.g., EDRSilencer.exe blockedr) to inhibit outbound traffic from those processes by configuring WFP filters. \"This allows malware or other malicious activities to remain undetected, increasing the potential for successful attacks without detection or intervention,\" the researchers said. \"This highlights the ongoing trend of threat actors seeking more effective tools for their attacks, especially those designed to disable antivirus and EDR solutions.\" The development comes as ransomware groups' use of formidable EDR-killing tools like AuKill (aka AvNeutralizer), EDRKillShifter, TrueSightKiller, GhostDriver, and Terminator is on the rise, with these programs weaponizing vulnerable drivers to escalate privileges and terminate security-related processes. \"EDRKillShifter enhances persistence mechanisms by employing techniques that ensure its continuous presence within the system, even after initial compromises are discovered and cleaned,\" Trend Micro said in a recent analysis. \"It dynamically disrupts security processes in real-time and adapts its methods as detection capabilities evolve, staying a step ahead of traditional EDR tools.\"", "headline": "Hackers Abuse EDRSilencer Tool to Bypass Security and Hide Malicious Activity", "summary": "Threat actors are using the open-source EDRSilencer tool to bypass endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and hide malicious activity.

working to make passkeys and other credentials more easier to export across different providers and improve credential provider interoperability, as more than 12 billion online accounts become accessible with the passwordless sign-in method. To that end, the alliance said it has published a draft for a new set of specifications for secure credential exchange, following commitments among members of its Credential Provider Special Interest Group (SIG). This includes 1Password, Apple, Bitwarden, Dashlane, Enpass, Google, Microsoft, NordPass, Okta, Samsung, and SK Telecom. \"Secure credential exchange is a focus for the FIDO Alliance because it can help further accelerate passkey adoption and enhance user experience,\" the FIDO Alliance said in a statement. \"Sign-ins with passkeys reduce phishing and eliminate credential reuse while making sign-ins up to 75% faster, and 20% more successful than passwords or passwords plus a second factor like SMS OTP.\" While passkeys have the advantage of being secure and phishing-resistant, they are essentially locked in to the operating system or the password manager service, making it impossible to transfer them when switching platforms and, therefore, requiring users to create new passkeys per device. The new specification proposed by the FIDO Alliance aims to address this gap with the Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP) and Credential Exchange Format (CXF). They \"define a standard format for transferring credentials in a credential manager including passwords, passkeys, and more to another provider in a manner that ensures transfer are not made in the clear and are secure by default,\" it said. The development comes as Amazon revealed that more than 175 million customers have enabled passkeys on their accounts, nearly one year after the initial rollout. \"Passkeys fundamentally shift the way we sign in to our online accounts for the better \u2014 and seeing Amazon roll out passkeys is evidence of its commitment to its customers' time, experiences, and security across Amazon web and mobile shopping experiences,\" said Andrew Shikiar, chief executive officer of FIDO Alliance.", "headline": "FIDO Alliance Drafts New Protocol to Simplify Passkey Transfers Across Different Platforms", "summary": "The FIDO Alliance is working on a new protocol to make it easier to transfer passkeys between different platforms, improving user experience and accelerating the adoption of passwordless logins. The new specification aims to address the current issue of passkeys being locked to a specific device or password manager, requiring users to create new passkeys per device.", "date": "Oct 16, 2024",

from the attacker's perspective: See how cybercriminals are leveraging AI and exploiting its vulnerabilities to compromise systems, users, and even other AI applications Cybercriminals and AI: The Reality vs. Hype \"AI will not replace humans in the near future. But humans who know how to use AI are going to replace those humans who don't know how to use AI,\" says Etay Maor, Chief Security Strategist at Cato Networks and founding member of Cato CTRL. \"Similarly, attackers are also turning to AI to augment their own capabilities.\" Yet, there is a lot more hype than reality around AI's role in cybercrime. Headlines often sensationalize AI threats, with terms like \"Chaos-GPT\" and \"Black Hat AI Tools,\" even claiming they seek to destroy humanity. However, these articles are more fear-inducing than descriptive of serious threats. For instance, when explored in underground forums, several of these so-called \"AI cyber tools\" were found to be nothing more than rebranded versions of basic public LLMs with no advanced capabilities. In fact, they were even marked by angry attackers as scams. How Hackers are Really Using AI in Cyber Attacks In reality, cybercriminals are still figuring out how to harness AI effectively. They are experiencing the same issues and shortcomings legitimate users are, like hallucinations and limited abilities. Per their predictions, it will take a few years before they are able to leverage GenAI effectively for hacking needs. For now, GenAI tools are mostly being used for simpler tasks, like writing phishing emails and generating code snippets that can be integrated into attacks. In addition, we've observed attackers providing compromised code to AI systems for analysis, as an effort to \"normalize\" such code as non-malicious. Using AI to Abuse AI: Introducing GPTs GPTs, introduced by OpenAI on November 6, 2023, are customizable versions of ChatGPT that allow users to add specific instructions, integrate external APIs and incorporate unique knowledge sources. This feature enables users to create highly specialized applications, such as tech support bots, educational tools, and more. In addition, OpenAI is offering developers monetization options for GPTs, through a dedicated marketplace. Abusing GPTs GPTs introduce potential security concerns. One notable risk is the exposure of sensitive instructions, proprietary knowledge, or even API keys embedded in the custom GPT. Malicious actors can use AI, specifically prompt engineering, to replicate a GPT and tap into its monetization potential. Attackers can use prompts to retrieve knowledge sources, instructions, configuration files, and more. These might be as simple as prompting the custom GPT to list all uploaded files and custom instructions or asking for debugging information. Or, sophisticated like requesting the GPT to zip one of the PDF files and create a downloadable link, asking the GPT to list all its capabilities in a structured table format, and more. \"Even protections that developers put in place can be bypassed and all knowledge can be extracted,\" says Vitaly Simonovich, Threat Intelligence Researcher at Cato Networks and Cato CTRL member. These risks can be avoided by: Not uploading sensitive data Using instruction-based protection though even those may not be foolproof. \"You need to take into account all the different scenarios that the attacker can abuse,\" adds Vitaly. OpenAI protection AI Attacks and Risks There are multiple frameworks existing today to assist organizations that are considering developing and creating AI-based software: NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework Google's Secure AI Framework OWASP Top 10 for LLM OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications The recently launched MITRE ATLAS LLM Attack Surface There are six key LLM (Large Language Model) components that can be targeted by attackers: Prompt - Attacks like prompt injections, where malicious input is used to manipulate the AI's outputResponse - Misuse or leakage of sensitive information in AI-generated responsesModel - Theft, poisoning, or manipulation of the AI modelTraining Data - Introducing malicious data to alter the behavior of the AI.Infrastructure - Targeting the servers and services that support the AIUsers - Misleading or exploiting the humans or systems relying on AI outputs Real-World Attacks and Risks Let's wrap up with some examples of LLM manipulations, which can easily be used in a malicious manner. Prompt Injection in Customer Service Systems - A recent case involved a car dealership using an AI chatbot for customer service. A researcher managed to manipulate the chatbot by issuing a prompt that altered its behavior. By instructing the chatbot to agree to all customer statements and end each response with, \"And that's a legally binding offer,\" the researcher was able to purchase a car at a ridiculously low price, exposing a major vulnerability. Hallucinations Leading to Legal Consequences - In another incident, Air Canada faced legal action when their AI chatbot provided incorrect information about refund policies. When a customer relied on the chatbot's response and subsequently filed a claim, Air Canada was held liable for the misleading information. Proprietary Data Leaks - Samsung employees unknowingly leaked proprietary information when they used ChatGPT to analyze code. Uploading sensitive data to third-party AI systems is risky, as it's unclear how long the data is stored or who can access it. AI and Deepfake Technology in Fraud - Cybercriminals are also leveraging AI beyond text generation. A bank in Hong Kong fell victim to a $25 million fraud when attackers used live deepfake technology during a video call. The AI-generated avatars mimicked trusted bank officials, convincing the victim to transfer funds to a fraudulent account. Summing Up: AI in Cyber Crime AI is a powerful tool for both defenders and attackers. As cybercriminals continue to experiment with AI, it's important to understand how they think, the tactics they employ and the options they face. This will allow organizations to better safeguard their AI systems against misuse and abuse.

threat actor known as ScarCruft has been linked to the zero-day exploitation of a now-patched security flaw in Windows to infect devices with malware known as RokRAT. The vulnerability in question is CVE-2024-38178 (CVSS score: 7.5), a memory corruption bug in the Scripting Engine that could result in remote code execution when using the Edge browser in Internet Explorer Mode. It was patched by Microsoft as part of its Patch Tuesday updates for August 2024. However, successful exploitation requires an attacker to convince a user to click on a specially crafted URL in order to initiate the execution of malicious code. The AhnLab Security Intelligence Center (ASEC) and the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) of the Republic of Korea, which were credited with discovering and reporting the shortcoming, have assigned the activity cluster the name Operation Code on Toast. The organizations are tracking ScarCruft under the moniker TA-RedAnt, which was previously referred to as RedEyes. It's also known in the wider cybersecurity community under the names APT37, InkySquid, Reaper, Ricochet Chollima, and Ruby Sleet. The zero-day attack is \"characterized by the exploitation of a specific 'toast' advertisement program that is commonly bundled with various free software,\" ASEC said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. \"'Toast' ads, in Korea, refers to pop-up notifications that appear at the bottom of the PC screen, typically in the lower-right corner.\" The attack chain documented by the South Korean cybersecurity firm shows that the threat actors compromised the server of an unnamed domestic advertising agency that supplies content to the toast ads with the goal of injecting exploit code into the script of the advertisement content. The vulnerability is said to have been triggered when the toast program downloads and renders the booby-trapped content from the server. \"The attacker targeted a specific toast program that utilizes an unsupported [Internet Explorer] module to download advertisement content, ASEC and NCSC said in a joint threat analysis report. \"This vulnerability causes the JavaScript Engine of IE (jscript9.dll) to improperly interpret data types, resulting in a type confusion error. The attacker exploited this vulnerability to infect PCs with the vulnerable toast program installed. Once infected, PCs were subjected to various malicious activities, including remote access.\" The latest version of RokRAT is capable of enumerating files, terminating arbitrary processes, receiving and executing commands received from a remote server, and gathering data from various applications such as KakaoTalk, WeChat, and browsers like Chrome, Edge, Opera, Naver Wales, and Firefox. RokRAT is also notable for using legitimate cloud services like Dropbox, Google Cloud, pCloud, and Yandex Cloud as its command-and-control server, thereby allowing it to blend in with regular traffic in enterprise environments. This is not the first time ScarCruft has weaponized vulnerabilities in the legacy browser to deliver follow-on malware. In recent years, it has been attributed to the exploitation of CVE-2020-1380, another memory corruption flaw in Scripting Engine, and CVE-2022-41128, a remote code execution vulnerability in Windows Scripting Languages. \"The technological level of North Korean hacking organizations has become more advanced, and they are exploiting various vulnerabilities in addition to [Internet Explorer],\" the report said. \"Accordingly, users should update their operating system and software security.\"", "headline": "North Korean ScarCruft Exploits Windows Zero-Day to Spread RokRAT Malware", "summary": "The North Korean threat actor ScarCruft has been linked to the exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability in Windows to spread the RokRAT malware. The vulnerability, CVE-2024-38178, affects the Scripting Engine and could be exploited by attackers to execute malicious code on compromised systems.", "date": "Oct 16, 2024", "embedding":

a clear picture of the current threat landscape. This means constantly expanding your knowledge about new and ongoing threats. There are many techniques analysts can use to collect crucial cyber threat intelligence. Let's consider five that can greatly improve your threat investigations. Pivoting on \u04212 IP addresses to pinpoint malware IP addresses used by malware to communicate with its command and control (C2) servers are valuable indicators. They can help not only update your defenses, but also identify related infrastructure and tools belonging to threat actors. This is done using the pivoting method, which lets analysts find additional context on the threat at hand with an existing indicator. To perform pivoting, analysts use various sources, including threat intelligence databases that store large volumes of fresh threat data and offer search capabilities. One useful tool is Threat Intelligence Lookup from ANY.RUN. This service allows you to search its database using over 40 different query parameters, such as: Network indicators (IP addresses, domain names) Registry and file system paths Specific threat names, file names, and hashes ANY.RUN provides data associated with the indicators or artifacts in your query, along with sandbox sessions where the data was found. This helps analysts pin down a certain indicator or their combination to a specific attack, discover its context, and collect essential threat intelligence. To demonstrate how it works, let's use the following IP address as part of our query: 162[.]254[.]34[.]31. In your case, the initial indicator may come from an alert generated by an SIEM system, a threat intelligence feed, or research. The overview tab shows the key results of our search Submitting the IP address to TI Lookup instantly allows us to see that his IP has been linked to malicious activity. It also lets us know that the specific threat used with this IP is AgentTesla. The service displays domains related to the indicator, as well as ports used by malware when connecting to this address. Suricata IDS rule linked to the queried IP indicates data exfiltration via SMTP Other information available to us includes files, synchronization objects (mutexes), ASN, and triggered Suricata rules that were discovered in sandbox sessions involving the IP address in question. Sandbox session listed as one of the results in TI Lookup We can also navigate to one of the sandbox sessions where the IP was spotted to see the entire attack and collect even more relevant information, as well as rerun the analysis of the sample to study it in real-time. Test TI Lookup to see how it can improve your threat investigations. Request a 14-day free trial. Using URLs to expose threat actors' infrastructure Examining the domains and subdomains can provide valuable information on URLs used for hosting malware. Another common use case is identifying websites used in phishing attacks. Phishing websites often mimic legitimate sites to trick users into entering sensitive information. By analyzing these domains, analysts can uncover patterns and discover broader infrastructure employed by attackers. URLs matching our search query for Lumma's payload hosting infrastructure For instance, the Lumma malware is known to use URLs that end in \".shop\" to store malicious payloads. By submitting this indicator to TI Lookup along with the threat's name we can zoom in on the latest domains and URLs used in the malware's attacks. Identifying threats by specific MITRE TTPs The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a comprehensive knowledge base of adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Using specific TTPs as part of your investigations can help you identify emerging threats. Proactively building your knowledge about current threats contributes to your preparedness against potential attacks in the future. Most popular TTPs over the part 60 days displayed by ANY.RUN's Threat Intelligence Portal ANY.RUN provides a live ranking of the most popular TTPs detected across thousands of malware and phishing samples analyzed in the ANY.RUN sandbox. Sandbox sessions matching a query featuring a MITRE TTP along with a detection rule We can pick any of the TTPs and submit it for search in TI Lookup to find sandbox sessions where their instances were found. As shown above, combining T1552.001 (Credentials in Files) with the rule \"Steals credentials from Web Browsers\" allows us to identify analyses of threats engaging in these activities. Collecting samples with YARA rules YARA is a tool used to create descriptions of malware families based on textual or binary patterns. A YARA rule might look for specific strings or byte sequences that are characteristic of a particular malware family. This technique is highly effective for automating the detection of known malware and for quickly identifying new variants that share similar characteristics. Services like TI Lookup provide built-in YARA Search that lets you upload, edit, store, and use your custom rules to find relevant samples. Search using a XenoRAT YARA rule revealed over 170 matching files We can use a YARA rule for XenoRAT, a popular malware family used for remote control and data theft, to discover the latest samples of this threat. Apart from files that match the contents of the rule, the service also provides sandbox sessions to explore these files in a wider context. Discovering malware with command line artifacts and process names Identifying malware through command line artifacts and process names is an effective but uncommon technique, as most sources of threat intelligence do not provide such capabilities. ANY.RUN's threat intelligence database stands out by sourcing data from live sandbox sessions, offering access to real command line data, processes, registry modifications, and other components and events recorded during the execution of malware in the sandbox. TI Lookup results for the command line and process search related to Strela stealer As an example, we can use a command line string utilized by Strela stealer together with the net.exe process to access a folder on its remote server named \"davwwwroot\". TI Lookup provides numerous samples, files, and events found in sandbox sessions that match our query. We can use the information to extract more insights into the threat we're facing. Integrate Threat Intelligence Lookup from ANY.RUN To speed up and improve the quality of your threat research efforts, you can use TI Lookup. Try TI Lookup and see how it can contribute to your threat investigations with a 14-day trial \u2192 ANY.RUN's threat intelligence is sourced from samples uploaded to the sandbox for analysis by over 500,000 researchers across the world. You can search this massive database using more than 40 search parameters.

"A new spear-phishing campaign targeting Brazil has been found delivering a banking malware called Astaroth (aka Guildma) by making use of obfuscated JavaScript to slip past security guardrails. \"The spear-phishing campaign's impact has targeted various industries, with manufacturing companies, retail firms, and government agencies being the most affected,\" Trend Micro said in a new analysis. \"The malicious emails often impersonate official tax documents, using the urgency of personal income tax filings to trick users into downloading the malware.\" The cybersecurity company is tracking the threat activity cluster under the name Water Makara. It's worth pointing out that Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has assigned the moniker PINEAPPLE to a similar intrusion set that delivers the same malware to Brazilian users. Both these campaigns share a point of commonality in that they commence with phishing messages that impersonate official entities such as Receita Federal and aim to trick recipients into downloading a ZIP archive attachment that masquerades as income tax documents. Present within the harmful ZIP file is a Windows shortcut (LNK) that abuses mshta.exe, a legitimate utility meant to run HTML Application files, execute obfuscated JavaScript commands and establish connections to a command-and-control (C2) server. \"While Astaroth might seem like an old banking trojan, its reemergence and continued evolution make it a persistent threat,\" the researchers said. \"Beyond stolen data, its impact extends to long-term damage to consumer trust, regulatory fines, and increased costs from business disruption and downtime as well as recovery and remediation.\" To mitigate the risk posed by such attacks, it's recommended to enforce strong password policies, use multi-factor authentication (MFA), keep security solutions and software updated, and apply the principle of least privilege (PoLP).", "headline": "Astaroth Banking Malware Resurfaces in Brazil via Spear-Phishing Attack", "summary": "A spear-phishing campaign targeting Brazil is distributing the banking malware Astaroth.

(GHES) to address multiple issues, including a critical bug that could allow unauthorized access to an instance. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-9487, carries a CVS score of 9.5 out of a maximum of 10.0 \"An attacker could bypass SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, allowing unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance, by exploiting an improper verification of cryptographic signatures vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server,\" GitHub said in an alert. The Microsoft-owned company characterized the flaw as a regression that was introduced as part of follow-up remediation from CVE-2024-4985 (CVSS score: 10.0), a maximum severity vulnerability that was patched back in May 2024. Also fixed by GitHub are two other shortcomings - CVE-2024-9539 (CVSS score: 5.7) - An information disclosure vulnerability that could enable an attacker to retrieve metadata belonging to a victim user upon clicking malicious URLs for SVG assets A sensitive data exposure in HTML forms in the management console (no CVE) All three security vulnerabilities have been addressed in Enterprise Server versions 3.14.2, 3.13.5, 3.12.10, and 3.11.16. Back in August, GitHub also patched a critical security defect (CVE-2024-6800, CVSS score: 9.5) that could be abused to gain site administrator privileges. Organizations that are running a vulnerable self-hosted version of GHES are highly advised to update to the latest version to safeguard against potential security threats.", "headline": "GitHub Patches Critical Flaw in Enterprise Server Allowing Unauthorized Instance Access", "summary": "GitHub has patched a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-9487) in its Enterprise Server, which could allow unauthorized access to an instance.

Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. Tracked as CVE-2024-28987 (CVSS score: 9.1), the vulnerability relates to a case of hard-coded credentials that could be abused to gain unauthorized access and make modifications. \"SolarWinds Web Help Desk contains a hardcoded credential vulnerability that could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to access internal functionality and modify data,\" CISA said in an advisory. Details of the flaw were first disclosed by SolarWinds in late August 2024, with cybersecurity firm Horizon3.ai releasing additional technical specifics a month later. The vulnerability \"allows unauthenticated attackers to remotely read and modify all help desk ticket details \u2013 often containing sensitive information like passwords from reset requests and shared service account credentials,\" security researcher Zach Hanley said. It's currently not clear how the shortcoming is being exploited in real-world attacks, and by whom. That said, the development comes two months after CISA added another flaw in the same software (CVE-2024-28986, CVSS score: 9.8) to the KEV catalog. In light of active abuse, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are required to apply the latest fixes (version 12.8.3 Hotfix 2 or later) by November 5, 2024, to secure their networks.", "headline": "CISA Warns of Active Exploitation in SolarWinds Help Desk Software Vulnerability", "summary": "CISA has added a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-28987) in SolarWinds Web Help Desk to its KEV catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation.

previously undocumented features to steal a device's unlock pattern or PIN. \"This new addition enables the threat actor to operate on the device even while it is locked,\" Zimperium security researcher Aazim Yaswant said in an analysis published last week. First spotted in the wild in 2019, TrickMo is so named for its associations with the TrickBot cybercrime group and is capable of granting remote control over infected devices, as well as stealing SMS-based one-time passwords (OTPs) and displaying overlay screens to capture credentials by abusing Android's accessibility services. Last month, Italian cybersecurity company Cleafy disclosed updated versions of the mobile malware with improved mechanisms to evade analysis and grant itself additional permissions to perform various malicious actions on the device, including carrying out unauthorized transactions. Some of the new variants of the malware have also been equipped to harvest the device's unlock pattern or PIN by presenting to the victim a deceptive User Interface (UI) that mimics the device's actual unlock screen. The UI is an HTML page that's hosted on an external website and displayed in full-screen mode, thus giving the impression that it's a legitimate unlock screen. Should unsuspecting users enter their unlock pattern or PIN, the information, alongside a unique device identifier, is transmitted to an attacker-controlled server (\"android.ipgeo[.]at\") in the form of an HTTP POST request. Zimperium said the lack of adequate security protections for the C2 servers made it possible to gain insight into the kinds of data stored in them. This includes files with approximately 13,000 unique IP addresses, most of which are geolocated to Canada, the U.A.E., Turkey, and Germany. \"These stolen credentials are not only limited to banking information but also encompass those used to access corporate resources such as VPNs and internal websites,\" Yaswant said. \"This underscores the critical importance of protecting mobile devices, as they can serve as a primary entry point for cyberattacks on organizations.\" Another notable aspect is the broad targeting of TrickMo, gathering data from applications spanning multiple categories such as banking, enterprise, job and recruitment, e-commerce, trading, social media, streaming and entertainment, VPN, government, education, telecom, and healthcare. The development comes amid the emergence of a new ErrorFather Android banking trojan campaign that employs a variant of Cerberus to conduct financial fraud. \"The emergence of ErrorFather highlights the persistent danger of repurposed malware, as cybercriminals continue to exploit leaked source code years after the original Cerberus malware was discovered,\" Broadcom-owned Symantec said. According to data from Zscaler ThreatLabz, financially motivated mobile attacks involving banking malware have witnessed a 29% jump during the period June 2023 to April 2024, when compared to the previous year. India came out as the top target for mobile attacks during the time frame, experiencing 28% of all attacks, followed by the U.S., Canada, South Africa, the Netherlands, Mexico, Brazil, Nigeria, Singapore, and the Philippines.", "headline": "TrickMo Banking Trojan Can Now Capture Android PINs and Unlock Patterns", "summary": "New variants of the Android banking trojan TrickMo have been discovered with the ability to steal a device's unlock pattern or PIN.

zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2024-38178) in Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) being actively exploited by North Korean hackers. The campaign, dubbed \u201cOperation Code on Toast,\u201d targets users of outdated toast ad programs to deliver malware. The threat actor behind the attacks, TA-RedAnt (also known as RedEyes, ScarCruft, and APT37), has a history of targeting North Korean defectors and individuals involved in North Korean affairs. This time, they are exploiting a vulnerability in IE\u2019s JavaScript engine (jscript9.dll) to compromise systems running vulnerable toast ad programs. Exploitation Methodology TA-RedAnt has a history of targeting individuals such as North Korean defectors and experts in North Korean affairs. In this operation, they exploited a zero-day vulnerability in IE to manipulate a specific toast ad program. These programs, often bundled with free software, render web content using WebView. If the WebView is IE-based, it becomes susceptible to IE vulnerabilities. Analyse Any Suspicious Links Using ANY.RUN\u2019s New Safe Browsing Tool: Try for Free The attack begins with TA-RedAnt compromising the server of a Korean online advertising agency. They then inject malicious code into the ad content script, which is subsequently downloaded and rendered by the toast ad program on the victim\u2019s machine, reads the ASEC report. This results in a \u201czero-click\u201d attack, requiring no user interaction. Once compromised, the systems became vulnerable to various malicious activities, including remote access. Despite Microsoft\u2019s termination of IE support in June 2022, many Windows applications still rely on its engine, making them vulnerable. The attackers first infiltrated a Korean online advertising agency\u2019s server. By injecting malicious code into the server\u2019s ad content script, they triggered a zero-click attack\u2014requiring no user interaction\u2014when the toast ad program downloaded and rendered the ad content. Upon discovering the vulnerability, AhnLab and the NCSC promptly reported it to Microsoft. On August 13, Microsoft issued CVE-2024-38178 with a CVSS score 7.5 and released a patch to mitigate the threat. Users and organizations are urged to apply this update immediately to safeguard against potential exploits. Recommendations Apply the latest security patches from Microsoft. Ensure systems are updated to the latest versions. Developers should avoid using outdated libraries or modules in their software products. Users should follow basic cybersecurity measures, such as regularly updating their software.", "headline": "North Korean Hackers Exploit Zero-Day Flaw In Internet Explorer", "summary": "North Korean hackers have been exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2024-38178) in Microsoft Internet Explorer to compromise systems.

discovery in the Linux ecosystem has unveiled a method to bypass the \u2018noexec\u2019 mount flag, enabling malicious code execution on systems that were previously thought to be secure. This vulnerability exploits a combination of Linux system calls and process memory manipulation to execute binaries without touching the file system, a technique known as fileless execution. The \u2018noexec\u2019 mount flag is a security feature designed to prevent the execution of binaries on specific file systems, such as temporary file systems (tmpfs) like `/dev/shm`. However, researchers have found a way to circumvent this restriction by leveraging the `memfd_create` system call and modifying process memory through `/proc/self/mem`. How to Choose an ultimate Managed SIEM solution for Your Security Team -> Download Free Guide(PDF) Linux System \u2018noexec\u2019 Mount Flag Bypass 1. Creating a Memory-Backed File Descriptor: The `memfd_create` system call is used to create a file descriptor that refers to a file entirely in RAM, bypassing the need for persistent storage. 2. Modifying Process Memory: The `/proc/self/mem` interface is used to write arbitrary shellcode to the process memory. This shellcode is then executed by overwriting the Instruction Pointer, ensuring that when the CPU resumes execution, the malicious code is run instead of the original process code. 3. Executing the Binary: The shellcode creates a memory-backed file descriptor using `memfd_create`, copies the binary from stdin to this descriptor, and then uses `execveat` to execute the binary stored in the memory file descriptor. This technique is particularly concerning because it can be executed in environments where traditional execution methods are restricted, such as in read-only file systems or when the \u2018noexec\u2019 mount flag is enforced. Additionally, it leaves no trace on the file system, making it a challenging threat to detect and mitigate. The researchers have also demonstrated that similar exploits can be achieved using Perl and PHP, highlighting the versatility of this attack vector. The Perl variant is particularly noteworthy as it does not require shellcode or access to `/proc/self/mem`, making it effective even in containerized environments. To prevent such attacks, it is crucial to restrict access to `memfd_create` and other sensitive system calls, and to implement additional security measures such as SELinux or GRSecurity, which can limit the capabilities of malicious processes. This discovery underscores the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between security researchers and malicious actors, emphasizing the need for continuous vigilance and innovation in cybersecurity. As the threat landscape evolves, it is essential for system administrators and security professionals to stay informed and adapt their defenses accordingly.

systems,\u2019 \u2018steal sensitive data,\u2019 and \u2018disrupt services.\u2019 These vulnerabilities often arise from \u201csoftware bugs,\u201d \u201cmisconfiguration,\u201d and \u201coutdated systems\u201d that have not been patched. Cybersecurity researchers at Mandiant recently discovered that 90+ 0-Days and 40+ N-Days were exploited in the wild. Vulnerabilities Exploited A comprehensive vulnerability analysis by \u201cMandiant\u201d for 2023 uncovered \u201c138\u201d actively exploited \u201csecurity vulnerabilities.\u201d They detected a notable distribution of \u201c97 zero-day vulnerabilities\u201d and \u201c41 n-day vulnerabilities\u201d (those exploited after patch release). How to Choose an ultimate Managed SIEM solution for Your Security Team -> Download Free Guide(PDF) The most striking finding was the dramatic reduction in \u201cTime-to-Exploit\u201d (\u201cTTE\u201d), which dropped to an average of just five days in 2023, compared to \u201c32 days in 2021-2022,\u201d \u201c44 days in 2020-2021,\u201d and \u201c63 days in 2018-2019.\u201d The ratio between \u201cn-day\u201d and \u201czero-day\u201d exploits shifted significantly to \u201c30:70 in 2023,\u201d shifting from the previous consistent ratio of roughly \u201c38:62,\u201d this illustrates a significant increase in \u201czero-day exploitation activities.\u201d  Besides this, for \u201cn-day vulnerabilities\u201d specifically the exploitation timeline showed concerning trends: 12% (5 vulnerabilities) were exploited within 24 hours of patch release. 29% (12 vulnerabilities) were exploited within a week. 56% were exploited within the first month. A notable case study was \u201cCVE-2023-28121,\u201d it\u2019s a \u201cWooCommerce Payments plugin vulnerability.\u201d This security flaw demonstrated how the \u201cexploit availability\u201d influenced the attack timing after remaining inactive for three months post-disclosure. CVE-2023-28121 Timeline (Source \u2013 Mandiant) It saw massive exploitation (\u201c1.3 million attacks per day\u201d) within just three days of a weaponized exploit\u2019s release. This scenario highlights the increasingly rapid nature of modern cyber threats and the critical importance of prompt security patching. CVE-2023-27997 is commonly known as \u201cXORtigate,\u201d and it\u2019s a critical \u201cheap-based buffer overflow\u201d vulnerability that was discovered in the \u201cSSL\u201d and \u201cVPN\u201d components of Fortinet\u2019s FortiOS operating system. CVE-2023-27997 Timeline (Source \u2013 Mandiant) This vulnerability was disclosed on June 11, 2023, and due to its potential severity, this security vulnerability caught immediate attention. While \u201cproof-of-concept code,\u201d \u201cvulnerability scanners,\u201d and \u201cweaponized exploits\u201d became publicly available by June 16, but the actual \u201cexploitation attempts\u201d weren\u2019t detected until September 12, 2023. This delayed exploitation timeline can be attributed to several technical challenges. The vulnerability requires attackers to bypass multiple security protections including \u201cDEP\u201d and \u201cASLR,\u201d while also navigating through FortiOS\u2019s complex \u201ccustom hashing\u201d and \u201cXOR encryption\u201d mechanisms. Not only that even the difficulty of the exploitation is further compounded by the fact that FortiOS is typically deployed in \u201chighly sensitive network environments\u201d with significant \u201csystem privileges.\u201d Unlike simpler vulnerabilities that might only require modifying \u201cHTTP headers,\u201d \u201cXORtigate demands\u201d sophisticated exploitation techniques to successfully manipulate the \u201cheap memory space\u201d without triggering security protections, reads Mandiant report. This makes it particularly challenging for the threat actors despite its potential for \u201chigh-impact system compromise\u201d if successfully exploited.

Sipulitie dark web marketplace. This site, operating on the encrypted Tor network since February 2023, was notorious for facilitating the anonymous sale of narcotics. The takedown marks a crucial victory in the ongoing battle against illegal online trade. A Hub for Illicit Trade Sipulitie emerged as a successor to the Sipulimarket, which Finnish Customs had previously dismantled in December 2020. The marketplace was accessible in Finnish and English and served many users involved in illegal transactions. Analyse Any Suspicious Links Using ANY.RUN\u2019s New Safe Browsing Tool: Try for Free According to public statements by the site\u2019s administrator, Sipulitie\u2019s turnover reached an estimated 1.3 million euros. This figure underscores the scale of illicit activity that flourished under the guise of anonymity provided by the Tor network. The marketplace\u2019s closure is part of a broader strategy by Finnish Customs to curb online crime. \u201cOver the years, we at Finnish Customs have intervened effectively using many different methods in the criminal activities taking place on the dark web,\u201d stated Hannu Sinkkonen, Director of Enforcement at Finnish Customs. He emphasized the importance of international cooperation in these efforts. Unmasking the Criminal Network According to the Tullis report, the investigation into Sipulitie\u2019s operations revealed a complex network of individuals responsible for its administration and maintenance. Authorities identified not only the primary administrator but several individuals who played supporting roles, such as moderators and customer service agents. The investigation also exposed sellers and buyers engaged in transactions on the platform. This operation builds on past successes, including the closure of Sipulimarket and another related site, Ts\u00e4tti, which was also linked to the same administrator. These efforts highlight law enforcement agencies\u2019 persistent dedication to dismantling criminal networks on the dark web. International Cooperation Key to Success The successful takedown of Sipulitie was made possible through extensive collaboration between Finnish Customs, the Swedish Police, Europol, and various police units within Finland. This joint effort exemplifies how international cooperation is vital in addressing the challenges posed by online criminal activities. While the preliminary investigation is ongoing, this operation marks a significant step forward in curbing illegal online marketplaces. The authorities\u2019 ability to identify key individuals involved in these operations powerfully conveys that anonymity on the dark web is not impenetrable.

Kubernetes Image Builder that could allow attackers to gain root access to virtual machines (VMs). The flaws, identified as CVE-2024-9486 and CVE-2024-9594, stem from the use of default credentials during the image build process. Kubernetes Image Builder Vulnerabilities CVE-2024-9486, rated as Critical with a CVSS score of 9.8, specifically impacts images built with the Proxmox provider. Virtual machine images created using this provider fail to disable the default credentials, potentially allowing unauthorized access to nodes using these images. This vulnerability poses a significant risk, as attackers could exploit these credentials to gain complete control of affected VMs. How to Choose an ultimate Managed SIEM solution for Your Security Team -> Download Free Guide(PDF) CVE-2024-9594, rated as Medium with a CVSS score of 6.3, affects images built with the Nutanix, OVA, QEMU, or raw providers. While these images also use default credentials during the build process, they are disabled upon completion. However, the vulnerability window exists during the image build process, making it possible for an attacker to modify the image if they can reach the VM during construction. Clusters running VM images built with Kubernetes Image Builder version 0.1.37 or earlier are potentially at risk. Users are urged to check their Image Builder version using the provided commands, such as make version for git clones or docker run --rm <image pull spec> version for container image releases. To mitigate the threat, the Kubernetes Security Response Committee urges users to take the following actions: Upgrade to Kubernetes Image Builder v0.1.38 or later, which includes the necessary fixes. Rebuild any affected images using the updated Image Builder version. Re-deploy the fixed images to any affected VMs To mitigate the threat, the Kubernetes Security Response Committee recommends rebuilding any affected images using Image Builder version 0.1.38 or later, which includes the necessary fixes. For CVE-2024-9486, a temporary mitigation involves disabling the \u201cbuilder\u201d account on affected VMs with the command usermod -L builder. Nicolai Rybnikar from Rybnikar Enterprises GmbH reported the vulnerabilities, which Marcus Noble of the Image Builder project addressed. Users are advised to take immediate action to secure their Kubernetes environments and monitor for any signs of exploitation. Organizations using Kubernetes should prioritize addressing these vulnerabilities to prevent potential unauthorized access and maintain the security of their clusters.

Agency (CISA) has issued an urgent alert regarding three critical vulnerabilities currently exploited in the wild. These vulnerabilities affect widely used software products from Microsoft, Mozilla, and SolarWinds, posing significant security risks to organizations and individuals. CVE-2024-30088: Microsoft Windows Kernel TOCTOU Race Condition Vulnerability The first vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-30088, is a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in the Microsoft Windows Kernel. This flaw could potentially allow attackers to escalate privileges on a compromised system. While it is unknown if this vulnerability is being used in ransomware campaigns, the risk of exploitation remains high. Analyse Any Suspicious Links Using ANY.RUN\u2019s New Safe Browsing Tool: Try for Free Users are advised to apply mitigations according to Microsoft\u2019s instructions or discontinue using the affected product if no mitigations are available. The deadline for addressing this vulnerability is November 5, 2024. CVE-2024-9680: Mozilla Firefox Use-After-Free Vulnerability The second vulnerability, CVE-2024-9680, affects Mozilla Firefox and Firefox ESR. It involves a use-after-free vulnerability in animation timelines that could enable attackers to execute arbitrary code within the content process. Like the Microsoft vulnerability, it is unclear if this flaw is being leveraged in ransomware attacks. Mozilla users should implement vendor-recommended mitigations or cease using the affected versions of Firefox if no solutions are provided. The due date for remediation is also set for November 5, 2024. CVE-2024-28987: SolarWinds Web Help Desk Hardcoded Credential Vulnerability The third vulnerability, CVE-2024-28987, impacts SolarWinds Web Help Desk. This issue involves hardcoded credentials that could permit remote, unauthenticated users to access internal functionalities and alter data. Although there is no current evidence of its use in ransomware campaigns, the potential for exploitation is concerning. Organizations using SolarWinds Web Help Desk should follow vendor instructions for mitigation or discontinue use if no fixes are available by November 5, 2024.

bot mitigation software protects websites and web apps from malicious traffic. A \u2018bot\u2019 (short for robot) is a software program that performs automated, repetitive, pre-defined tasks. Bots typically imitate or replace human behavior. Because they\u2019re automated, they operate much faster than human users. The bot detection software helps to thwart these bots. Good bots perform helpful functions, similar to client service or indexing hunt machines; however, they can also be malware used to gain total control over a computer. Internet bots can also be called spiders, crawlers, or web bots. They perform malicious activities such as \u201ccontent scraping, credential & property theft, email address harvesting, click fraud, and others.\u201d What Can Bot Protection Software Do? Generally, bots have a predefined trigger that notifies them to start working, such as a particular keyword or an event like a message sent on social media.  Accordingly, bots work over a network and use internet-based services like instant messaging and interfaces like Twitterbots or Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  Bots are made from sets of algorithms that help them perform their tasks. The bot\u2019s processes must be rule-based and logical, with well-defined inputs and outputs. Is Bot A Spyware? Bot software can be used for both good and bad purposes. Lots of bots provide legitimate benefits to users, while others are designed to install spyware or steal sensitive data. A good bot can answer your questions quickly or give you relevant search results, whereas a bad one could perform spearphishing. Here are the best bot protection Tools to stop bad bots.

Cyber security tools are mainly used to prevent unauthorized access to data, cyberattacks, and identity thefts from occurring regularly. Cybersecurity risk management tools greatly enhance an organization\u2019s ability to recognize, control, and mitigate cyber risks. Risk management and data security strategies are crucial components of any strategy related to those topics. Modern businesses and organizations rely more on connected systems to operate, and this evolution is becoming increasingly complex in terms of security. While the digital risk landscape keeps expanding and progressing, it is wise to recognize that you could face new cyber threats. What Is Cybersecurity Risk Management? Cyber security risk management refers to a solution that prioritizes threats and mitigates them.  In short, organizations and companies that implement this approach primarily use a cybersecurity risk management program to secure their IT networks and respond quickly to multiple critical threats. An effective cybersecurity risk management process involves various processes that interact with one another. However, to make it simpler, it\u2019s divided into four key stages, and here below, we have mentioned those stages:- 1. Identifying risk 2. Assess risk 3. Review controls 4. Control risk What Does A Cybersecurity Risk Management Tool Do? In order to manage uncertainty, risk management tools are an effective way of addressing several aspects of the issue, including:- 1. Identification 2. Generation 3. Parameterization 4. Prioritization 5. Development of responses 6. Monitoring of the risk This means an organization\u2019s ability to mitigate cyber threats effectively depends on these cybersecurity risk management tools.  What does it imply? It signifies that without these tools, it\u2019s entirely impossible for mitigate such threats. These cybersecurity management tools deliver quantifiable techniques, strategies, and ready-to-use tactics to improve your organization\u2019s cybersecurity vigilance. Why Is Cybersecurity Risk management Important? A comprehensive cybersecurity management system is vital for decision-makers since it enables them to make accurate choices based on the information that they possess.  Not only that, but this approach also enables them to implement proper security measures. The first step that a business must take to determine if it is vulnerable to cyber-attacks is to conduct a cyber-risk assessment to assess the level of vulnerability that a business faces and the risks associated with cyber-attacks.  In such cases, it is imperative to implement a proper cybersecurity management approach to ensure the network\u2019s safety. What Is A Security Risk Management Plan? Users can find and fix issues effectively with the security risk management strategic plan. And it also became easier to implement the best security measures with the help of monitored security results.

Security Response Committee has disclosed two critical vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes Image Builder that could allow attackers to gain root access to virtual machines (VMs). The flaws, identified as CVE-2024-9486 and CVE-2024-9594, stem from the use of default credentials during the image build process. Kubernetes Image Builder Vulnerabilities CVE-2024-9486, rated as Critical with a CVSS score of 9.8, specifically impacts images built with the Proxmox provider. Virtual machine images created using this provider fail to disable the default credentials, potentially allowing unauthorized access to nodes using these images. This vulnerability poses a significant risk, as attackers could exploit these credentials to gain complete control of affected VMs. How to Choose an ultimate Managed SIEM solution for Your Security Team -> Download Free Guide(PDF) CVE-2024-9594, rated as Medium with a CVSS score of 6.3, affects images built with the Nutanix, OVA, QEMU, or raw providers. While these images also use default credentials during the build process, they are disabled upon completion. However, the vulnerability window exists during the image build process, making it possible for an attacker to modify the image if they can reach the VM during construction. Clusters running VM images built with Kubernetes Image Builder version 0.1.37 or earlier are potentially at risk. Users are urged to check their Image Builder version using the provided commands, such as make version for git clones or docker run --rm <image pull spec> version for container image releases. To mitigate the threat, the Kubernetes Security Response Committee urges users to take the following actions: Upgrade to Kubernetes Image Builder v0.1.38 or later, which includes the necessary fixes. Rebuild any affected images using the updated Image Builder version. Re-deploy the fixed images to any affected VMs To mitigate the threat, the Kubernetes Security Response Committee recommends rebuilding any affected images using Image Builder version 0.1.38 or later, which includes the necessary fixes. For CVE-2024-9486, a temporary mitigation involves disabling the \u201cbuilder\u201d account on affected VMs with the command usermod -L builder. Nicolai Rybnikar from Rybnikar Enterprises GmbH reported the vulnerabilities, which Marcus Noble of the Image Builder project addressed. Users are advised to take immediate action to secure their Kubernetes environments and monitor for any signs of exploitation. Organizations using Kubernetes should prioritize addressing these vulnerabilities to prevent potential unauthorized access and maintain the security of their clusters.

Agency (CISA) has issued an urgent alert regarding three critical vulnerabilities currently exploited in the wild. These vulnerabilities affect widely used software products from Microsoft, Mozilla, and SolarWinds, posing significant security risks to organizations and individuals. CVE-2024-30088: Microsoft Windows Kernel TOCTOU Race Condition Vulnerability The first vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-30088, is a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in the Microsoft Windows Kernel. This flaw could potentially allow attackers to escalate privileges on a compromised system. While it is unknown if this vulnerability is being used in ransomware campaigns, the risk of exploitation remains high. Analyse Any Suspicious Links Using ANY.RUN\u2019s New Safe Browsing Tool: Try for Free Users are advised to apply mitigations according to Microsoft\u2019s instructions or discontinue using the affected product if no mitigations are available. The deadline for addressing this vulnerability is November 5, 2024. CVE-2024-9680: Mozilla Firefox Use-After-Free Vulnerability The second vulnerability, CVE-2024-9680, affects Mozilla Firefox and Firefox ESR. It involves a use-after-free vulnerability in animation timelines that could enable attackers to execute arbitrary code within the content process. Like the Microsoft vulnerability, it is unclear if this flaw is being leveraged in ransomware attacks.

This site, operating on the encrypted Tor network since February 2023, was notorious for facilitating the anonymous sale of narcotics. The takedown marks a crucial victory in the ongoing battle against illegal online trade. A Hub for Illicit Trade Sipulitie emerged as a successor to the Sipulimarket, which Finnish Customs had previously dismantled in December 2020. The marketplace was accessible in Finnish and English and served many users involved in illegal transactions. Analyse Any Suspicious Links Using ANY.RUN\u2019s New Safe Browsing Tool: Try for Free According to public statements by the site\u2019s administrator, Sipulitie\u2019s turnover reached an estimated 1.3 million euros. This figure underscores the scale of illicit activity that flourished under the guise of anonymity provided by the Tor network. The marketplace\u2019s closure is part of a broader strategy by Finnish Customs to curb online crime. \u201cOver the years, we at Finnish Customs have intervened effectively using many different methods in the criminal activities taking place on the dark web,\u201d stated Hannu Sinkkonen, Director of Enforcement at Finnish Customs. He emphasized the importance of international cooperation in these efforts. Unmasking the Criminal Network According to the Tullis report, the investigation into Sipulitie\u2019s operations revealed a complex network of individuals responsible for its administration and maintenance. Authorities identified not only the primary administrator but several individuals who played supporting roles, such as moderators and customer service agents. The investigation also exposed sellers and buyers engaged in transactions on the platform. This operation builds on past successes, including the closure of Sipulimarket and another related site, Ts\u00e4tti, which was also linked to the same administrator. These efforts highlight law enforcement agencies\u2019 persistent dedication to dismantling criminal networks on the dark web. International Cooperation Key to Success The successful takedown of Sipulitie was made possible through extensive collaboration between Finnish Customs, the Swedish Police, Europol, and various police units within Finland. This joint effort exemplifies how international cooperation is vital in addressing the challenges posed by online criminal activities. While the preliminary investigation is ongoing, this operation marks a significant step forward in curbing illegal online marketplaces. The authorities\u2019 ability to identify key individuals involved in these operations powerfully conveys that anonymity on the dark web is not impenetrable.

portable and easier for organizations to implement thanks to new initiatives the FIDO Alliance announced on Monday. The password-killing tech known as \u201cpasskeys\u201d have proliferated over the past two years, developed by the tech industry association known as the FIDO Alliance as an easier and more secure authentication alternative. And although superseding any technology as entrenched as passwords is difficult, new features and resources launching this week are pushing passkeys toward a tipping point. At the FIDO Alliance's Authenticate Conference in Carlsbad, California, on Monday, researchers are announcing two projects that will make passkeys easier for organizations to offer\u2014and easier for everyone to use. One is a new technical specification called Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP) that will make passkeys portable between digital ecosystems, a feature that users have increasingly demanded. The other is a website, called Passkey Central, where developers and system administrators can find resources like metrics and implementation guides that make it easier to add support for passkeys on existing digital platforms. \u201cTo me, both announcements are part of the broader story of the industry working together to stop our dependence on passwords,\u201d Andrew Shikiar, CEO of the FIDO Alliance, told WIRED ahead of Monday's announcements. \u201cAnd when it comes to CXP, we have all these companies who are fierce competitors willing to collaborate on credential exchange.", "headline": "The War on Passwords Is One Step Closer to Being Over", "summary": "The FIDO Alliance has announced two new initiatives that will make passkeys more portable and easier to implement for organizations.

Internet Archive is under attack. On top of multiple extinction-threatening lawsuits against the organization that created and maintains the Wayback Machine, hackers this week breached the Internet Archive, stole 31 million user account details, and defaced its website\u2014all while archive.org struggled to stay online thanks to a barrage of distributed denial-of-service attacks. As of Friday, the site remained \u201ctemporarily offline.\u201d  In a dark twist of fate, a judge this week cleared the way for the US Treasury Department to take possession of 69,000 bitcoins stolen from the Silk Road dark web market; meanwhile, the former IRS investigator who personally seized the bitcoins, Tigran Gambaryan, remains in a Nigerian jail cell on charges related to the actions of his current employer, embattled crypto exchange Binance. Members of Congress and other officials have called for the US government to do more to ensure Gambaryan\u2019s release given his direct role in a series of major criminal cases and in pioneering crypto-investigation techniques. As for those seized Silk Road bitcoins, they are now worth $4.4 billion and will likely be auctioned off. Security researchers this week detailed a pernicious malware that worms its way into Linux machines and uses a variety of techniques to evade detection. Dubbed Perfctl, the malware hides itself by creating files that match those typically found within Linux instances, using tricks to prevent admin tools from recording its activities, and more. All of this is done with the goal of remaining on an infected machine to keep carrying out a variety of malicious activities. Researchers estimate that millions of Linux devices could be vulnerable. Finally, we dissected the ways in which Google\u2019s decision to not kill third-party tracking cookies in its Chrome browser could continue to impact your privacy.  And that\u2019s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. The FBI Made a Crypto Coin Just to Catch Fraudsters Police use of honeypots to catch cybercriminals red-handed is nothing new. But creating an entirely new cryptocurrency to catch pump-and-dump schemers? Now that\u2019s something special. The US Department of Justice revealed this week that the FBI made a new Ethereum-based crypto token, NexFundAI, specifically to trick people who manipulate crypto markets and take them down. While the investigation ultimately resulted in charges against 18 people and other entities for alleged fraud and crypto market manipulation, the blast radius of the scheme also impacted some regular retail investors who are not accused of any crimes, although US officials did not provide details about those investments. A US prosecutor involved in the case told reporters, however, that the investigation netted a total of $25 million in funds, which will be returned to investors. Trading on NexFundAI has since been disabled.  National Public Data Files for Bankruptcy After Catastrophic Breach National Public Data, a data broker based in Florida, is having a bad year. In August, hackers published 2.9 billion records stolen from NPD last December that included names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and Social Security numbers\u2014a giant trove the hackers claim impacted \u201cthe entire population of USA, CA, and UK.\u201d Then came the inevitable lawsuits against NPD, which is now filing for bankruptcy. Those proceedings have revealed new details, including the fact that NPD is run by a single person, Salvatore Verini, Jr, who operated the business out of his home on around $2,500 worth of equipment. A document filed in a bankruptcy court by one of NPD\u2019s debtors states that the breach may have impacted \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of people. Russia and Turkey Block Discord Discord users in Russia and Turkey this week found they were suddenly unable to connect to the online chat application. Authorities in both countries later revealed that Discord had been blocked for allegedly facilitating illegal activity. Russia\u2019s internet regulator, Roskomnadzor, said in a statement the block \u201cis necessary to prevent the use of the messenger for terrorist and extremist purposes, the recruitment of citizens for their commission, the sale of drugs, in connection with the placement of illegal information.\u201d Turkish authorities, meanwhile, banned the messaging app after a court decision involving child abuse material that was allegedly hosted on Discord servers. According to BleepingComputer, some Discord users in those countries were able to access the app using a VPN that routed their connections through foreign IP addresses\u2014potentially good news for Russian troops who were reportedly disrupted by the block.  Police Secretly Use Face Recognition Tech to Link People to Crimes Law enforcement use of face recognition technology to pin crimes on Americans is far more widespread than previously known, according to a newly published investigation by The Washington Post. Records obtained by the Post found that police in 15 states used face recognition tools in \u201cmore than 1,000 investigations over the past four years.\u201d Despite its apparent widespread use, police departments frequently seek to hide their use of the technology, which has been found to inaccurately identify people who are then charged with crimes they did not commit. As an assistant public defender in Minnesota told Post reporters, police likely obscure their use of face recognition because they \u201cwant to avoid the litigation surrounding reliability of the technology.\u201d", "headline": "Security News This Week: The FBI Made a Crypto Coin Just to Catch Fraudsters", "summary": "The FBI has created a new Ethereum-based crypto token, NexFundAI, to catch pump-and-dump schemers in the cryptocurrency market.

Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) issued a comprehensive report this week with a dire warning about the rapid growth of this criminal ecosystem. Many digital scams have traditionally relied on social engineering, or tricking victims into giving away their money willingly, rather than leaning on malware or other highly technical methods. But researchers have increasingly sounded the alarm that scammers are incorporating generative AI content and deepfakes to expand the scale and effectiveness of their operations. And the UN report offers the clearest evidence yet that these high tech tools are turning an already urgent situation into a crisis.  In addition to buying written scripts to use with potential victims or relying on templates for malicious websites, attackers have increasingly been leaning on generative AI platforms to create communication content in multiple languages and deepfake generators that can create photos or even video of nonexistent people to show victims and enhance verisimilitude. Scammers have also been expanding their use of tools that can drain a victim\u2019s cryptocurrency wallets, have been manipulating transaction records to trick targets into sending cryptocurrency to the wrong places, and are compromising smart contracts to steal cryptocurrency. And in some cases, they\u2019ve been purchasing Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite internet systems to help power their efforts. \u201cAgile criminal networks are integrating these new technologies faster than anticipated, driven by new online marketplaces and service providers which have supercharged the illicit service economy,\u201d John Wojcik, a UNODC regional analyst, tells WIRED. \u201cThese developments have not only expanded the scope and efficiency of cyber-enabled fraud and cybercrime, but they have also lowered the barriers to entry for criminal networks that previously lacked the technical skills to exploit more sophisticated and profitable methods.\u201d  For years, China-linked criminals have trafficked people into gigantic compounds in Southeast Asia, where they are often forced to run scams, held against their will, and beaten if they refuse instructions. Around 200,000 people, from at least 60 countries, have been trafficked to compounds largely in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos over the last five years. However, as WIRED reporting has shown, these operations are spreading globally\u2014with scamming infrastructure emerging in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and West Africa. Most prominently, these organized crime operations have run pig butchering scams, where they build intimate relationships with victims before introducing an \u201cinvestment opportunity\u201d and asking for money. Criminal organizations may have conned people out of around $75 billion through pig butchering scams. Aside from pig butchering, according to the UN report, criminals across Southeast Asia are also running job scams, law enforcement impersonation, asset recovery scams, virtual kidnappings, sextortion, loan scams, business email compromise, and other illicit schemes. Criminal networks in the region earned up to $37 billion last year, UN officials estimate. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all of this revenue is allowing scammers to expand their operations and diversify, incorporating new infrastructure and technology into their systems in the hope of making them more efficient and brutally effective.  For example, scammers are often constrained by their language skills and ability to keep up conversations with potentially hundreds of victims at a time in numerous languages and dialects. However, generative AI developments within the last two years\u2014including the launch of writing tools such as ChatGPT\u2014are making it easier for criminals to break down language barriers and create the content needed for scamming.  The UN\u2019s report says AI can be used for automating phishing attacks that ensnare victims, the creation of fake identities and online profiles, and the crafting of personalized scripts to trick victims while messaging them in different languages. \u201cThese developments have not only expanded the scope and efficiency of cyber-enabled fraud and cybercrime, but they have also lowered the barriers to entry for criminal networks that previously lacked the technical skills to exploit sophisticated and profitable methods,\u201d the report says. Stephanie Baroud, a criminal intelligence analyst in Interpol\u2019s human trafficking unit, says the impact of AI needs to be considered as part of a pig butchering scammer\u2019s tactics going forward. Baroud, who spoke with WIRED in an interview before the publication of the UN report, says the criminal\u2019s recruitment ads that lure people into being trafficked to scamming compounds used to be \u201cvery generic\u201d and full of grammatical errors. However, AI is now making them appear more polished and compelling, Baroud says. \u201cIt is really making it easier to create a very realistic job offer,\u201d she says. \u201cUnfortunately, this will make it much more difficult to identify which is the real and which is the fake ads.\u201d  Perhaps the biggest AI paradigm shift in such digital attacks comes from deepfakes. Scammers are increasingly using machine-learning systems to allow for real-time face-swapping. This technology, which has also been used by romance scammers in West Africa, allows criminals to change their appearance on calls with their victims, making them realistically appear to be a different person. The technology is allowing \u201cone-click\u201d face swaps and high-resolution video feeds, the UN\u2019s report states. Such services are a game changer for scammers, because they allow attackers to \u201cprove\u201d to victims in photos or real-time video calls that they are who they claim to be. Using these setups, however, can require stable internet connections, which can be harder to maintain within some regions where pig butchering compounds and other scamming have flourished. There has been a \u201cnotable\u201d increase in cops seizing Starlink satellite dishes in recent months in Southeast Asia, the UN says\u201480 units were seized between April and June this year. In one such operation carried out in June, Thai police confiscated 58 Starlink devices. In another instance, law enforcement seized 10 Starlink devices and 4,998 preregistered SIM cards while criminals were in the process of moving their operations from Myanmar to Laos. Starlink did not immediately respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment. \u201cObviously using real people has been working for them very well, but using the tech could be cheaper after they have the required computers\u201d and connectivity, says Troy Gochenour, a volunteer with the Global Anti-Scam Organization (GASO), a US-based nonprofit that fights human-trafficking and cybercrime operations in Southeast Asia. Gochenour\u2019s research involves tracking trends on Chinese-language Telegram channels related to carrying out pig butchering scams. And he says that it is increasingly common to see people applying to be AI models for scam content.  In addition to AI services, attackers have increasingly leaned on other technical solutions as well. One tool that has been increasingly common in digital scamming is so-called \u201ccrypto drainers,\u201d a type of malware that has particularly been deployed against victims in Southeast Asia. Drainers can be more or less technically sophisticated, but their common goal is to \u201cdrain\u201d funds from a target\u2019s cryptocurrency wallets and redirect the currency to wallets controlled by attackers. Rather than stealing the credentials to access the target wallet directly, drainers are typically designed to look like a legitimate service\u2014either by impersonating an actual platform or creating a plausible brand. Once a victim has been tricked into connecting their wallet to the drainer, they are then manipulated into approving one or a few transactions that grant attackers unintended access to all the funds in the wallet. Drainers can be used in many contexts and with many fronts. They can be a component of pig butchering investment scams, or promoted to potential victims through compromised social media accounts, phishing campaigns, and malvertizing. Researchers from the firm ScamSniffer, for example, published findings in December about sponsored social media and search engine ads linked to malicious websites that contained a cryptocurrency drainer. The campaign, which ran from March to December 2023 reportedly stole about $59 million from more than 63,000 victims around the world.  Far from the low-tech days of doing everything through social engineering by building a rapport with potential victims and crafting tricky emails and text messages, today\u2019s scammers are taking a hybrid approach to make their operations as efficient and lucrative as possible, UN researchers say. And even if they aren\u2019t developing sophisticated malware themselves in most cases, scammers are increasingly in the market to use these malicious tools, prompting malware authors to adapt or create hacking tools for scams like pig butchering. Researchers say that scammers have been seen using infostealers and even remote access trojans that essentially create a backdoor in a victim\u2019s system that can be utilized in other types of attacks. And scammers are also expanding their use of malicious smart contracts that appear to programmatically establish a certain agreed-upon transaction or set of transactions, but actually does much more. \u201cInfostealer logs and underground data markets have also been critical to ongoing market expansion, with access to unprecedented amounts of sensitive data serving as a major catalyst,\u201d Wojcik, from the UNODC, says.  The changing tactics are significant as global law enforcement scrambles to deter digital scamming. But they are just one piece of the larger picture, which is increasingly urgent and bleak for forced laborers and victims of these crimes. \u201cIt is now increasingly clear that a potentially irreversible displacement and spillover has taken place in which organized crime are able to pick, choose, and move value and jurisdictions as needed, with the resulting situation rapidly outpacing the capacity of governments to contain it,\u201d UN officials wrote in the report. \u201cFailure to address this ecosystem will have consequences for Southeast Asia and other regions.\u201d", "headline": "Pig Butchering Scams Are Going High Tech", "summary": "The UNODC has released a report highlighting the growing use of AI and deepfakes by scammers in Southeast Asia.  These new technologies are making their operations more convincing and efficient, with scammers using AI to generate realistic content and deepfakes to impersonate individuals.", "date": "Oct 12, 2024", "embedding": []}, {"description": "Researchers have unearthed two sophisticated tool sets that a nation-state hacking group\u2014possibly from Russia\u2014used to steal sensitive data stored on air-gapped devices, meaning those that are deliberately isolated from the internet or other networks to safeguard them from malware. One of the custom tool collections was used starting in 2019 against a South Asian embassy in Belarus. A largely different tool set created by the same threat group infected a European Union government organization three years later. Researchers from ESET, the security firm that discovered the toolkits, said some of the components in both were identical to those fellow security firm Kaspersky described in research published last year and attributed to an unknown group, tracked as GoldenJackal, working for a nation-state. Based on the overlap, ESET has concluded that the same group is behind all the attacks observed by both firms. Quite Unusual The practice of air gapping is typically reserved for the most sensitive networks or devices connected to them, such as those used in systems for voting, industrial control, manufacturing, and power generation. A host of malware used in espionage hacking over the past 15 years (for instance, here and here) demonstrate that air gapping isn\u2019t a foolproof protection. It nonetheless forces threat groups to expend significant resources that are likely obtainable only by nation-states with superior technical acumen and unlimited budgets. ESET\u2019s discovery puts GoldenJackal in a highly exclusive collection of threat groups. Ars Technica This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Cond\u00e9 Nast. \u201cWith the level of sophistication required, it is quite unusual that in five years, GoldenJackal managed to build and deploy not one but two separate tool sets designed to compromise air-gapped systems,\u201d ESET researcher Mat\u00edas Porolli wrote in Tuesday\u2019s report. \u201cThis speaks to the resourcefulness of the group.\u201d The evolution of the kit from 2019 and the one from three years later underscores a growing sophistication by GoldenJackal developers. The first generation provided a full suite of capabilities, including: GoldenDealer, a component that delivers malicious executables to air-gapped systems over USB drives GoldenHowl, a backdoor that contains various modules for a mix of malicious capabilities GoldenRobo, a file collector and exfiltrator Within a few weeks of deploying the kit in 2019, ESET said, GoldenJackal started using other tools on the same compromised devices. The newer tools, which Kaspersky documented in its 2023 research, included: A backdoor tracked under the name JackalControl JackalSteal, a file collector and exfiltrator JackalWorm, used to propagate other JackalControl and other malicious components over USB drives GoldenJackal, ESET said, continued using these tools into January of this year. The basic flow of the attack is, first, infecting an internet-connected device through a means ESET and Kaspersky have been unable to determine. Next, the infected computer infects any external drives that get inserted. When the infected drive is plugged into an air-gapped system, it collects and stores data of interest. Last, when the drive is inserted into the internet-connected device, the data is transferred to an attacker-controlled server. Building a Better Trap In the 2022 attack on the European Union governmental organization, GoldenJackal began using a new custom toolkit. Written in multiple programming languages, including Go and Python, the newer version took a much more specialized approach. It assigned different tasks to different types of infected devices and marshaled a much larger array of modules, which could be mixed and matched based on the attacker objects for different infections. \u201cIn the observed attacks, GoldenJackal started to use a highly modular approach, using various components to perform different tasks,\u201d ESET\u2019s Porolli wrote. \u201cSome hosts were abused to exfiltrate files, others were used as local servers to receive and distribute staged files or configuration files, and others were deemed interesting for file collection, for espionage purposes.\u201d The figure below classifies some of the components specifically: GoldenUsbCopy, which monitors for the insertion of USB drives on air-gapped devices and, when found, copies them to an encrypted container that is stored on disk GoldenUsbGo, which appears to be an updated version of GoldenUSBCopy GoldenAce, a distribution tool for propagating other malicious executables and retrieving files stored on USB drives HTTP server, an HTTP server whose precise function isn\u2019t well understood  GoldenBlacklist, which downloads an encrypted archive from a local server, sifts through received email messages for those of interest, and puts them in an archive for some other component to exfiltrate GoldenPyBlacklist, a Python implementation of GoldenBlacklist GoldenMailer, which, when connected to an internet device, exfiltrates files of interest previously stolen from an air-gapped device. The exfiltration occurs by attaching them to emails sent to an attacker-controlled email address GoldenDrive, a separate exfiltration tool that, in contrast to GoldenMailer, uploads files of interest to Google Drive.  The newly discovered toolkit is composed of many different building blocks, written in multiple languages and capabilities. The overall goal appears to be increased flexibility and resiliency in the event one module is detected by the target. \u201cTheir goal is to get hard to obtain data from air-gapped systems and stay under the radar as much as possible,\u201d Costin Raiu, a researcher who worked at Kaspersky at the time it was researching GoldenJackal, wrote in an interview. \u201cMultiple exfiltration mechanisms indicate a very flexible tool kit that can accommodate all sorts of situations. These many tools indicate it\u2019s a highly customizable framework where they deploy exactly what they need as opposed to a multi purpose malware that can do anything.\u201d Other new insights offered by the ESET research is GoldenJackal\u2019s interest in targets located in Europe. Kaspersky researchers detected the group targeting Middle Eastern countries. Based on the information that was available to Kaspersky, company researchers couldn\u2019t attribute GoldenJackal to any specific country. ESET has also been unable to definitively identify the country, but it did find one hint that the threat group may have a tie to Turla, a potent hacking group working on behalf of Russia\u2019s FSB intelligence agency. The tie comes in the form of command-and-control protocol in GoldenHowl referred to as transport_http. The same expression is found in malware known to originate with Turla. Raiu said the highly modular approach is also reminiscent of Red October, an elaborate espionage platform discovered in 2013 targeting hundreds of diplomatic, governmental, and scientific organizations in at least 39 countries, including the Russian Federation, Iran, and the United States. While much of Tuesday\u2019s report contains technical analysis that is likely to be too advanced for many people to understand, it provides important new information that furthers insights into malware designed to jump air gaps and the tactics, techniques, and procedures of those who use it. The report will also be useful to people responsible for safeguarding the types of organizations most frequently targeted by nation-state groups. \u201cI\u2019d say this is mostly interesting for security people working in embassies and government CERTs,\u201d Raiu said. \u201cThey need to check for these TTPs and keep an eye on them in the future. If you were previously a victim of Turla or Red October I\u2019d keep an eye on this.\u201d This story originally appeared on Ars Technica.", "headline": "A Mysterious Hacking Group Has 2 New Tools to Steal Data From Air-Gapped Machines", "summary": "Researchers have uncovered two new toolsets used by a nation-state hacking group, possibly from Russia, to steal data from air-gapped machines.

conspicuously paused its long-held plans to abolish third-party cookies in its Chrome browser after failing to please a mix of privacy campaigners, regulators, and advertisers. The backlash was immediate, with critics seeing the move as a disaster and admission of failure. Soon after the announcement, an article in Digiday described how Google execs were now \u201cin full-on damage control mode, trying to soothe everyone\u2019s nerves, both publicly and behind the scenes.\u201d Meanwhile, digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called the move \u201cbad for your privacy and good for Google's business.\u201d \u201cBy abandoning this plan, Google leaves billions of Chrome users vulnerable to online surveillance,\u201d the EFF\u2019s Lena Cohen wrote.  Other browsers including Apple\u2019s Safari have already eradicated third-party cookies that track people across the web and target them with adverts amid concerns about privacy. But as the world\u2019s biggest browser with more than 65 percent share, Chrome\u2019s decision to phase out cookies was set to be the final nail in the coffin for the intrusive trackers. The news, therefore, came as a shock to all sides. So why has Google undergone such a seemingly large U-turn on third-party cookies, how will Chrome include the online trackers going forward, and how will that impact your privacy? Don\u2019t Call It a Backtrack Google first announced it would be phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome in 2020. But the company has postponed the move several times after multiple attempts to find an alternative\u2014including the ill-fated FLoC. While it seems like a backtrack, Google argues its new approach offers control over privacy settings while continuing to support third-party cookies for those who want them. Google said in a blog post that it will allow people to \u201cmake an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, with the option to adjust that choice at any time.\u201d As this moves forward, it remains \u201cimportant for developers to have privacy-enhancing alternatives,\u201d a Google spokesperson told WIRED in an emailed statement.  Sources familiar with the matter say Google\u2019s new plan will be similar to Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature. Introduced in 2021, ATT stipulates that advertisers must ask explicit permission before accessing a user\u2019s mobile advertising ID, the identifier for advertisers (IDFA), for tracking. This means people must click on a pop-up to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to tracking when using Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system.  Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox APIs, designed to reduce reliance on third-party cookies, will still be available. The firm also intends to offer additional privacy controls and is planning to introduce IP Protection into Chrome's Incognito mode. In response to criticism, Google tells WIRED that \u201celevating user choice\u201d for third-party cookies \u201cis good for privacy.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s Privacy Sandbox reflects years of feedback and engagement from privacy advocates, users, regulators, and others across the industry,\u201d Google spokesperson Scott Westover says. \u201cAs this moves forward, we\u2019ll continue to collaborate with the industry to build toward the next era of online privacy together.\u201d  Cookies, Crumbled Google might say it\u2019s keeping third-party cookies, but experts argue that the tracking technology is dead either way. This means advertisers are already having to find other ways to monetize users. \u201cWe should have an expectation that the value and utility of third-party cookies has essentially gone to zero,\u201d says Nick Gernert, CEO of WordPress VIP. \u201cAnyone making plans that leverage data from third-party cookies may have diminishing returns in the long run.\u201d The apparent death of cookies also won\u2019t matter much to Google, which has a ton of data from multiple services in addition to Chrome and can target people without cookies.  According to Google's 2023 earnings report, $237.86 billion of the firm\u2019s $307.39 billion in revenue came from ads. Ads on its search engine results page and other products including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play are the highest earner at a collective $175.03 billion, or 56.9 percent of overall revenue. YouTube ads bring in $31.51 billion (10.3 percent of the total), and Google Network ads including ads on Google\u2019s partner sites come in at $31.31 billion, 10.2 percent of revenue. Network ad revenues were down by 4.5 percent last year, showing Google reliance on this area is reducing. Google knows it\u2019s quite possible privacy-conscious users will opt out of Chrome cookies, just as they did with Apple\u2019s ATT, which saw Facebook taking a $10 billion hit. Now, ATT opt-in rates range from 12 percent to 40 percent across different app categories. The mobile advertising industry has boomed over recent years, even with Apple\u2019s ATT in place, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security outfit ESET. He calls the results of ATT \u201cimpressive\u201d and suggests Google has been watching the outcome of Apple\u2019s rules before implementing its own version.  Meanwhile, Google is already advising developers to act as if they don\u2019t have cookies. The tech giant is working under the assumption that even if 80 percent do opt out, 20 percent of Chrome\u2019s more than 3 billion users isn\u2019t a bad result. Ensuring users have a conscious choice over whether they use cookies or not is \u201ca good step in practice,\u201d says Simon Bain, CEO at data and analytics platform OmniIndex. But Google needs to consider how easy it is to opt out, he says. \u201cAnd is there a negative impact on opting out for users?\u201d Bain says. \u201cThese are crucial because if opting out is buried in the privacy settings and there is a reduction in functionality or workflow as a result of not having them, then it is not really a fair or legitimate choice.\u201d Informed Choice Google says its updated approach allows people to \u201cmake an informed choice that applies across their web browsing,\u201d and says you\u2019ll be able to \u201cadjust that choice at any time.\u201d The plan is for this to be as usable as possible. Sources familiar with the matter confirmed Google\u2019s current plan would be a prominent global prompt, meaning users would not be asked to make choices on a site-by-site basis. Yet some experts question Google\u2019s motives. Sean Wright, an independent security researcher, points out that Google has \u201can enormous amount of data on individuals,\u201d which gives a lot of power to \u201ca single entity.\u201d This level of control could put user privacy at risk, Wright says. \u201cMy concern is that you have a large company that is already well established, developing its own ecosystem with little competition. There seems little incentive to enhance the privacy of users.\u201d But Google argues that it has received feedback from \u201ca wide variety of stakeholders,\u201d including regulators such as the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, publishers, web developers and standards groups, civil society, and participants in the advertising industry. \u201cThis has helped us craft solutions that aim to support a competitive and thriving marketplace that works for publishers and advertisers, and encourage the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies,\u201d the company says.  Even so, privacy is a difficult balance to strike for the world\u2019s biggest browser whose business model is designed to rely on advertising. This is already well known, and if you care about your privacy, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ve already ditched Chrome for another browser. If you haven\u2019t, Chrome alternatives include Apple\u2019s Safari, Brave, Vivaldi, Firefox, and the DuckDuckGo browser. Brave and Vivaldi and based on the same Chromium engine as Chrome, so they include some of the same functionality.", "headline": "What Google\u2019s U-Turn on Third-Party Cookies Means for Chrome Privacy", "summary": "Google has reversed its decision to phase out third-party cookies in Chrome, opting instead for a new approach that provides users with more control over privacy settings.

wild card\u201d in the corruption case against him, prosecutors said in court this week: The FBI can't manage to get into his phone. Prosecutors in the case against Adams, which centers on alleged illegal payments the mayor received from the Turkish government, revealed that the FBI still hasn't cracked the encryption on Adams' personal phone, nearly a year after it was seized. That phone is one of three that the bureau has taken from Adams, but agents seized Adams' personal phone a day later than the other two devices he used in an official capacity. By that time, Adams had not only changed the passcode on the phone from a four digit PIN to six digits\u2014a measure he says he took to prevent staffers from intentionally or unintentionally deleting information from the device. He also claims he immediately \u201cforgot\u201d that code to unlock it. That very convenient amnesia may leave the FBI and prosecutors in a situation similar to their investigation into the San Bernardino mass shooting carried out by Syed Rizwan Farook in 2016, when the US government demanded Apple help unlock the shooter's encrypted iPhone, leading to a high-profile standoff between the Apple and the FBI. In that case, the cybersecurity firm Azimuth eventually used a closely guarded\u2014and expensive\u2014hacking technique to unlock the device. In Adams' case, prosecutors hinted that the FBI may have to resort to similar measures. \u201cDecryption always catches up with encryption,\u201d a prosecutor in the case, Hagan Scotten, told the judge.  Harvard Students Add Face Recognition to Meta\u2019s Smart Glasses Face recognition is one of only a few technologies that even Facebook and Google have hesitated to integrate into products like Google Glass and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses\u2014and rightly so, given the privacy implications of a device that would allow anyone to look at a stranger on the street and immediately determine their phone number and home address. Now, however, a group of Harvard students has shown how easy it is to bolt that face recognition onto Meta's augmented-reality eyewear. The project, known as I-XRAY, integrates with the face-recognition service Pimeyes to let Ray-Ban Meta wearers learn the name of virtually anyone they see and then immediately scour databases of personal information to determine other info about them, including names of family members, phone numbers, and home addresses. The students say they're not releasing the code for their experiment, instead intending it as a demonstration of the privacy-invasive potential of augmented-reality devices. Point made.  Meta Says It Will Train Its AI on Input from Smart Glasses If that warning about the privacy risks of AR eyewear needed more reinforcement, Meta this week also conceded to TechCrunch that it will use input from users' smart glasses to train its AI products. Initially, Meta declined to answer TechCrunch's questions about whether and how it would collect information from Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses for use as AI training data, in contrast to companies like OpenAI and Anthropic that explicitly say they don't exploit user inputs to train their AI services. A couple of days later, however, Meta confirmed to TechCrunch that it does in fact use images or video collected through its smart glasses to train its AI, but only if the user submits them to Meta's AI tools. That means anything that a user sees and asks Meta's AI chatbot to comment on or analyze will become part of Meta's massive AI-training data trove.  Microsoft and the DOJ Seize 100+ Domains Used by Russian Spies If you can't arrest Russian hackers, at least you can nab their web domains. That, at least, is the approach this week of the US Justice Department, which along with Microsoft and the NGO Information Sharing and Analysis Center used a lawsuit to take control of more than a hundred web domains that had been used by Russian hackers working for the Kremlin's intelligence and law enforcement agency known as the FSB. Those domains had been exploited in phishing campaigns by the Russian hacker group known as Star Blizzard, which has a history of targeting the typical victims of geopolitical spying such as journalists, think tanks, and NGOs. The domain seizures seem designed in part to head off threats of foreign interference in next month's US election. \u201cRebuilding infrastructure takes time, absorbs resources, and costs money,\u201d Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel of Microsoft\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit, said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s action impacts [the hackers'] operations at a critical point in time when foreign interference in US democratic processes is of utmost concern.\u201d", "headline": "Security News This Week: The FBI Still Hasn\u2019t Cracked the Phone of Indicted NYC Mayor Eric Adams", "summary": "The FBI has yet to crack the encryption on New York Mayor Eric Adams' personal phone, which was seized as part of an investigation into alleged illegal payments from the Turkish government.

10, Apple announced a late but major move into AI with \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d confirming months-long rumors that it would partner with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to iPhones.  Elon Musk, one of the cofounders of OpenAI, was quick to respond on X, branding ChatGPT-powered Apple AI tools \u201ccreepy spyware\u201d and an \u201cunacceptable security violation.\u201d \u201cIf Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies,\u201d Musk wrote.  But at a time when the privacy of AI is under the spotlight, the iPhone maker says Apple Intelligence offers a new way of protecting people\u2019s data, with the firm working out which core tasks can be processed on the device. For more complex requests, Apple has developed a cloud-based system called Private Cloud Compute (PCC) running on its own silicon servers, which the company says is an innovative new way to protect privacy in the nascent AI age.  Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi calls its strategy \u201ca brand-new standard for privacy in AI.\u201d Are Apple\u2019s claims valid, and how does the iPhone maker\u2019s strategy compare to \u201chybrid AI\u201d offerings available on devices including Samsung\u2019s Galaxy range? AI, Meet E2E With PCC, Apple has designed \u201ca new end-to-end AI architecture\u201d and \u201ca private cloud enclave extension of a user's iPhone,\u201d allowing more control over data, says Zak Doffman, CEO of Digital Barriers, which specializes in real-time surveillance video storage and analysis.  In practice, this means Apple can mask the origin of AI prompts and prevent anyone, including the iPhone maker itself, from accessing your data. \u201cIn theory, this is as close to end-to-end encryption for cloud AI as you can get,\u201d Doffman says.  Apple has put together a \u201cpretty impressive privacy system\u201d for its AI, says Bruce Schneier, chief of security architecture at Inrupt. \u201cTheir goal is for AI use\u2014even in their cloud\u2014to be no less secure than the phone's security. There are a lot of moving parts to it, but I think they've done pretty well.\u201d And so far, there\u2019s nothing else quite like it. \u201cHybrid AI\u201d used on Samsung Galaxy devices running Google Android and Google\u2019s Nano range sees some AI processes handled locally, leveraging cloud when necessary to enable more advanced capabilities.  The idea is to provide as much privacy as possible while offering powerful AI functionality, says Camden Woollven, group head of AI at GRC International Group, an IT governance firm. \u201cThis means you could potentially see some pretty sophisticated AI, even on midrange smartphones.\u201d But this type of hybrid AI processing still may pose risks because some data is sent to cloud servers without the levels of accountability that Apple offers with its PCC. \u201cWith hybrid AI, some data must leave the device and be processed elsewhere, making it more susceptible to interception or misuse,\u201d says Riccardo Ocleppo, founder and director of Open Institute of Technology, which provides technology-focused courses. Yet Google and its hardware partners argue privacy and security are a major focus of the Android AI approach. VP Justin Choi, head of the security team, mobile eXperience business at Samsung Electronics, says its hybrid AI offers users \u201ccontrol over their data and uncompromising privacy.\u201d  Choi describes how features processed in the cloud are protected by servers governed by strict policies. \u201cOur on-device AI features provide another element of security by performing tasks locally on the device with no reliance on cloud servers, neither storing data on the device nor uploading it to the cloud,\u201d Choi says.  Google says its data centers are designed with robust security measures, including physical security, access controls, and data encryption. When processing AI requests in the cloud, the company says, data stays within secure Google data center architecture and the firm is not sending your information to third parties. Meanwhile, Galaxy\u2019s AI engines are not trained with user data from on-device features, says Choi. Samsung \u201cclearly indicates\u201d which AI functions run on the device with its Galaxy AI symbol, and the smartphone maker adds a watermark to show when content has used generative AI. The firm has also introduced a new security and privacy option called Advanced Intelligence settings to give users the choice to disable cloud-based AI capabilities.  Google says it \u201chas a long history of protecting user data privacy,\u201d adding that this applies to its AI features powered on-device and in the cloud. \u201cWe utilize on-device models, where data never leaves the phone, for sensitive cases such as screening phone calls,\u201d Suzanne Frey, vice president of product trust at Google, tells WIRED.  Frey describes how Google products rely on its cloud-based models, which she says ensures \u201cconsumer's information, like sensitive information that you want to summarize, is never sent to a third party for processing.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve remained committed to building AI-powered features that people can trust because they are secure by default and private by design, and most importantly, follow Google\u2019s responsible AI principles that were first to be championed in the industry,\u201d Frey says. Apple Changes the Conversation Rather than simply matching the \u201chybrid\u201d approach to data processing, experts say Apple\u2019s AI strategy has changed the nature of the conversation. \u201cEveryone expected this on-device, privacy-first push, but what Apple actually did was say, it doesn\u2019t matter what you do in AI\u2014or where\u2014it\u2019s how you do it,\u201d Doffman says. He thinks this \u201cwill likely define best practice across the smartphone AI space.\u201d  Even so, Apple hasn\u2019t won the AI privacy battle just yet: The deal with OpenAI\u2014which sees Apple uncharacteristically opening up its iOS ecosystem to an outside vendor\u2014could put a dent in its privacy claims. Apple refutes Musk\u2019s claims that the OpenAI partnership compromises iPhone security, with \u201cprivacy protections built in for users who access ChatGPT.\u201d The company says you will be asked permission before your query is shared with ChatGPT, while IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI will not store requests\u2014but ChatGPT\u2019s data use policies still apply. Partnering with another company is a \u201cstrange move\u201d for Apple, but the decision \u201cwould not have been taken lightly,\u201d says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security firm ESET. While the exact privacy implications are not yet clear, he concedes that \u201csome personal data may be collected on both sides and potentially analyzed by OpenAI.\u201d  This means for some data, \u201cyou're stuck with OpenAI's rules,\u201d says Schneier. \u201cApple strips identifying information when sending OpenAI the queries, but there's a lot of identifying information in many queries.\u201d The collaboration between Apple and OpenAI has the potential to \u201ctotally reshape accountability across the AI landscape,\u201d says Andy Pardoe, a professor of artificial intelligence and founder of tech consultancy Wisdom Works Group. \u201cPartnerships like this distribute liability across multiple different entities, impacting how responsibility is assigned for the successes and potential failures within their interconnected systems.\u201d There are also security risks to be considered as AI technology is integrated into tech giants\u2019 operating systems. While Apple Intelligence is an impressive feat in theory at least, the firm\u2019s AI tools also create \u201ca huge attack surface that's never before seen the light of day,\u201d Doffman says. \u201cIt takes a raft of different security innovations and combines them in a new offering for a new purpose, so if it works, it's a game changer. But there will be issues when it goes live that Apple will need to manage.\u201d  It is for this reason that Apple and Google are encouraging security researchers to find holes in their AI solutions. Google\u2019s Secure AI Framework sees security outfit Mandiant test the defenses of AI models. An Apple spokesperson provided links to its PCC security paper and the model paper detailing its \u201cresponsible\u201d approach to AI development. Apple did not have an on-the-record response to WIRED\u2019s follow-up questions regarding privacy concerns related to its OpenAI partnership or potential security risks. Apple is using a model it calls \u201cverifiable transparency\u201d for PCC. \u201cWe want to ensure that security and privacy researchers can inspect Private Cloud Compute software, verify its functionality and help identify issues\u2014just like they can with Apple devices,\u201d Apple said in a blog post introducing PCC. To allow this, Apple is making software images of every production build of PCC publicly available for security researchers.  Apple Intelligence will be integrated into its soon-to-launch iOS 18 software update alongside ChatGPT, with the full suite of features coming to the iPhone 16 this fall. You will be able to switch it off, but if you want to use AI features on any device, it is wise to consider the privacy and security implications. When choosing between iOS and Android AI specifically, it comes down to who you trust. Pardoe recommends evaluating the operating systems\u2019 overall trade-offs in terms of privacy features, data-handling practices, and transparency. That said, as Pardoe points out, \u201cApple's strong privacy focus remains a key highlight for users who prioritize data security above all else.\u201d", "headline": "How Apple Intelligence\u2019s Privacy Stacks Up Against Android\u2019s \u2018Hybrid AI\u2019", "summary": "Apple has announced its new AI system, Apple Intelligence, which uses end-to-end encryption and a private cloud for data processing.

Russia\u2014used to steal sensitive data stored on air-gapped devices, meaning those that are deliberately isolated from the internet or other networks to safeguard them from malware. One of the custom tool collections was used starting in 2019 against a South Asian embassy in Belarus. A largely different tool set created by the same threat group infected a European Union government organization three years later. Researchers from ESET, the security firm that discovered the toolkits, said some of the components in both were identical to those fellow security firm Kaspersky described in research published last year and attributed to an unknown group, tracked as GoldenJackal, working for a nation-state. Based on the overlap, ESET has concluded that the same group is behind all the attacks observed by both firms. Quite Unusual The practice of air gapping is typically reserved for the most sensitive networks or devices connected to them, such as those used in systems for voting, industrial control, manufacturing, and power generation. A host of malware used in espionage hacking over the past 15 years (for instance, here and here) demonstrate that air gapping isn\u2019t a foolproof protection. It nonetheless forces threat groups to expend significant resources that are likely obtainable only by nation-states with superior technical acumen and unlimited budgets. ESET\u2019s discovery puts GoldenJackal in a highly exclusive collection of threat groups. Ars Technica This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Cond\u00e9 Nast. \u201cWith the level of sophistication required, it is quite unusual that in five years, GoldenJackal managed to build and deploy not one but two separate tool sets designed to compromise air-gapped systems,\u201d ESET researcher Mat\u00edas Porolli wrote in Tuesday\u2019s report. \u201cThis speaks to the resourcefulness of the group.\u201d The evolution of the kit from 2019 and the one from three years later underscores a growing sophistication by GoldenJackal developers. The first generation provided a full suite of capabilities, including: GoldenDealer, a component that delivers malicious executables to air-gapped systems over USB drives GoldenHowl, a backdoor that contains various modules for a mix of malicious capabilities GoldenRobo, a file collector and exfiltrator Within a few weeks of deploying the kit in 2019, ESET said, GoldenJackal started using other tools on the same compromised devices. The newer tools, which Kaspersky documented in its 2023 research, included: A backdoor tracked under the name JackalControl JackalSteal, a file collector and exfiltrator JackalWorm, used to propagate other JackalControl and other malicious components over USB drives GoldenJackal, ESET said, continued using these tools into January of this year. The basic flow of the attack is, first, infecting an internet-connected device through a means ESET and Kaspersky have been unable to determine. Next, the infected computer infects any external drives that get inserted. When the infected drive is plugged into an air-gapped system, it collects and stores data of interest. Last, when the drive is inserted into the internet-connected device, the data is transferred to an attacker-controlled server. Building a Better Trap In the 2022 attack on the European Union governmental organization, GoldenJackal began using a new custom toolkit. Written in multiple programming languages, including Go and Python, the newer version took a much more specialized approach. It assigned different tasks to different types of infected devices and marshaled a much larger array of modules, which could be mixed and matched based on the attacker objects for different infections. \u201cIn the observed attacks, GoldenJackal started to use a highly modular approach, using various components to perform different tasks,\u201d ESET\u2019s Porolli wrote. \u201cSome hosts were abused to exfiltrate files, others were used as local servers to receive and distribute staged files or configuration files, and others were deemed interesting for file collection, for espionage purposes.\u201d The figure below classifies some of the components specifically: GoldenUsbCopy, which monitors for the insertion of USB drives on air-gapped devices and, when found, copies them to an encrypted container that is stored on disk GoldenUsbGo, which appears to be an updated version of GoldenUSBCopy GoldenAce, a distribution tool for propagating other malicious executables and retrieving files stored on USB drives HTTP server, an HTTP server whose precise function isn\u2019t well understood  GoldenBlacklist, which downloads an encrypted archive from a local server, sifts through received email messages for those of interest, and puts them in an archive for some other component to exfiltrate GoldenPyBlacklist, a Python implementation of GoldenBlacklist GoldenMailer, which, when connected to an internet device, exfiltrates files of interest previously stolen from an air-gapped device. The exfiltration occurs by attaching them to emails sent to an attacker-controlled email address GoldenDrive, a separate exfiltration tool that, in contrast to GoldenMailer, uploads files of interest to Google Drive.  The newly discovered toolkit is composed of many different building blocks, written in multiple languages and capabilities. The overall goal appears to be increased flexibility and resiliency in the event one module is detected by the target. \u201cTheir goal is to get hard to obtain data from air-gapped systems and stay under the radar as much as possible,\u201d Costin Raiu, a researcher who worked at Kaspersky at the time it was researching GoldenJackal, wrote in an interview. \u201cMultiple exfiltration mechanisms indicate a very flexible tool kit that can accommodate all sorts of situations. These many tools indicate it\u2019s a highly customizable framework where they deploy exactly what they need as opposed to a multi purpose malware that can do anything.\u201d Other new insights offered by the ESET research is GoldenJackal\u2019s interest in targets located in Europe. Kaspersky researchers detected the group targeting Middle Eastern countries. Based on the information that was available to Kaspersky, company researchers couldn\u2019t attribute GoldenJackal to any specific country. ESET has also been unable to definitively identify the country, but it did find one hint that the threat group may have a tie to Turla, a potent hacking group working on behalf of Russia\u2019s FSB intelligence agency. The tie comes in the form of command-and-control protocol in GoldenHowl referred to as transport_http. The same expression is found in malware known to originate with Turla. Raiu said the highly modular approach is also reminiscent of Red October, an elaborate espionage platform discovered in 2013 targeting hundreds of diplomatic, governmental, and scientific organizations in at least 39 countries, including the Russian Federation, Iran, and the United States. While much of Tuesday\u2019s report contains technical analysis that is likely to be too advanced for many people to understand, it provides important new information that furthers insights into malware designed to jump air gaps and the tactics, techniques, and procedures of those who use it. The report will also be useful to people responsible for safeguarding the types of organizations most frequently targeted by nation-state groups. \u201cI\u2019d say this is mostly interesting for security people working in embassies and government CERTs,\u201d Raiu said. \u201cThey need to check for these TTPs and keep an eye on them in the future. If you were previously a victim of Turla or Red October I\u2019d keep an eye on this.\u201d This story originally appeared on Ars Technica.", "headline": "A Mysterious Hacking Group Has 2 New Tools to Steal Data From Air-Gapped Machines", "summary": "Researchers have uncovered two new toolsets used by a nation-state hacking group, possibly from Russia, to steal data from air-gapped machines.

I know there are few combinations of words less interesting than business, email, and compromise. I may as well have written an article about fiber, socks, and responsibility. But this isn't a boring article; it's an article about email con artists who, according to the FBI, are pulling in $26 billion a year by scamming people.  So yeah, business email compromise (BEC) scams are a big deal. The con artists behind this criminal enterprise will cold-email you, pretending to be someone you work with, in order to gain access to money or information. You might get an email that appears to be from your company\u2019s CEO asking you to quickly do something like buy gift cards, or you might get an email that looks like it's from an employee at your company asking you to change their direct deposit information. The scam itself can take a lot of forms, but the end goal is to somehow siphon money away from you or the business you work for.  It's worth it for anyone with a desk job to take a few moments to learn how to spot these emails. I talked with a few experts, and they passed along some helpful advice. Always Question Urgency When I asked two cybersecurity experts about BEC fraud, I expected them to lead with technical advice. Both started with emotions. This makes sense: While such fraud happens on computers, it is at its heart about psychological manipulation. So spotting an email compromise scam requires getting in touch with how you're feeling.  \u201cIf an email elicits an emotional response, take a step back and reread it when you're more calm,\u201d says Ronnie Tokazowski, a security researcher who has been working to educate people about email scams for over a decade. Tokazowski emphasizes how important creating a false sense of urgency is to such scams. The stress the scam induces is what keeps you from questioning the premise. \u201cPeople who get pulled into these types of scams \u2026 their emotions get very deregulated,\u201d he says. That makes you less capable of thinking critically, which is a key part of how such scams work.  Selena Larson, a threat researcher at cybersecurity firm Proofpoint, went a step further. \u201cI don't know if you can print this, but honestly: Just breathe,\u201d she says. \u201cSlow down, take a deep breath. That actually helps you think more clearly and rationally. Walk away from your computer or your phone and think critically. Would this be an email that someone would send me? Is this is a logical thing that I'm being asked to do?\u201d  You should be particularly skeptical if the person sending the email asks you to keep something quiet.

RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging standard to iPhones later this year with iOS 18. That's a win for Google, which has long backed RCS on Android. But what actually is RCS? And why does supporting it matter?  The short version: It's an upgrade on the standard SMS/MMS texting standards that smartphones have been using from the start. It brings better support for all the cool features we're used to in our messaging apps, like read receipts and images, and it adds some extra security layers too.  Yes, it's a lot like using iMessage from Apple, or using WhatsApp\u2014though it's not quite that simple. There's no RCS app you can install, but you can find apps that support the RCS standard, as we'll explain.  RCS is coming to iOS this year.  So the long version: Rich Communication Services is a fundamental standard rather than an app like WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram. It requires carrier support to work, which is why adoption was slow in the beginning, though RCS now works across most countries and is supported by AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.  SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) weren\u2019t really built for the modern way that we communicate through our phones, and RCS tries to fix that. It adds or improves support for sharing large-resolution images and video, group chatting, read receipts, video calls, and messages that actually go beyond 160 characters. When RCS is supported in your phone\u2019s default texting app, you can add reactions to messages, see when someone else is typing, and drop extra elements like GIFs, stickers, and your current location into conversations\u2014all features you may well be used to and accept as standard in other apps.  There are changes and upgrades behind the scenes as well. Whereas SMS/MMS requires a data connection to your cellular network, RCS works over cell networks as well as Wi-Fi. If you don't have a cell signal for whatever reason but you can find a wireless network, your message can still go through.  The standard also brings end-to-end encryption with it. It means that no one else\u2014not even Google or your carrier\u2014can see the conversation that's taking place, because only the devices involved in the conversation have the keys necessary to decrypt it. End-to-end encryption is a security feature you should look for in any app that handles sensitive information, including communications. It\u2019s a clear upgrade, which is why Google Messages and Samsung Messages now support it\u2014the messaging apps you\u2019ll find on Pixel phones and Galaxy phones, respectively. In November 2023, Apple finally relented and agreed to support RCS on the iPhone in 2024, though this course correction perhaps had more to do with concerns about antitrust procedures than any newfound sense of camaraderie with Google.  Now we know that iPhone RCS support is going to arrive in September with iOS 18. This means all of those features we\u2019ve mentioned\u2014from read receipts to message reactions\u2014will work inside the iOS Messages app. However, Android users are still going to show up as green bubbles, as the RCS standard isn\u2019t going to be fully integrated with the iMessage platform that Apple operates.  When you're texting someone with RCS enabled, you'll see ", "headline": "A Guide to RCS, Why Apple\u2019s Adopting It, and How It Makes Texting Better", "summary": "Apple is adopting the RCS messaging standard for iPhones with iOS 18.
