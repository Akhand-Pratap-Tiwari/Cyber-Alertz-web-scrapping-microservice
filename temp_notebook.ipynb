As global organizations increasingly adopt cloud environments, security strategies have largely focused on \"shift-left\" practices—securing code, ensuring proper cloud posture, and fixing misconfigurations. However, this approach has led to an over-reliance on a multitude of DR tools spanning cloud infrastructure, workloads, and even applications. Despite these advanced tools, organizations often take weeks or even months to identify and resolve incidents. \\n\\nAdd to this the challenges of tool sprawl, soaring cloud security costs, and overwhelming volumes of false positives, and it becomes clear that security teams are stretched thin. Many are forced to make hard decisions about which cloud breaches they can realistically defend against. \\nBy following these five targeted steps, security teams can greatly improve their real-time detection and response capabilities for cloud attacks.\\nStep 1: Add Runtime Visibility and Protection \\nWhen security teams lack real-time visibility, they\\'re essentially operating blind, unable to respond effectively to threats. While cloud-native monitoring tools, container security solutions, and EDR systems offer valuable insights, they tend to focus on specific layers of the environment. A more comprehensive approach is achieved by using eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) sensors. eBPF enables deep, real-time observability across the entire stack—network, infrastructure, workloads, and applications—without disrupting production environments. By operating at the kernel level, it delivers visibility without adding performance overhead, making it a powerful solution for runtime security.\\nHere are some key capabilities to leverage for this step:\\n\\nTopology Graphs: Displays how hybrid or multi-cloud assets communicate and connect.\\nFull Asset Visibility: Showcases every asset in the environment, including clusters, networks, databases, secrets, and operating systems, all in one place.\\nExternal Connectivity Insights: Identifies connections to external entities, including details about the country of origin and DNS information.\\nRisk Assessments: Evaluate the risk level of each asset, alongside its impact on the business.\\n\\n\\nStep 2: Use a multi-layered detection strategy \\nAs attackers continue to evolve and evade detection, it becomes harder to find and stop breaches before they unfold. The biggest challenge in doing so lies in detecting cloud attack attempts where adversaries are stealth and exploit multiple attack surfaces— from network exploitation to data injection within a managed service — all while evading detection by cloud detection and response (CDR), cloud workload detection and response (CWPP/EDR), and application detection and response (ADR) solutions. This fragmented strategy has proven inadequate, allowing attackers to exploit gaps between layers to go unnoticed.\\nMonitoring cloud, workloads and application layers in a single platform provides the widest coverage and protection. It makes it possible to correlate application activity with infrastructure changes in real-time, ensuring attacks no longer slip through the cracks. \\nHere are some key capabilities to leverage for this step:\\n\\nFull-Stack Detection: Detects incidents from multiple sources across the cloud, applications, workloads, networks, and APIs. \\nAnomaly Detection: Utilizes machine learning and behavioral analysis to identify deviations from normal activity patterns that may indicate a threat.\\nDetects Known and Unknown Threats: Pinpoints events according to signatures, IoCs, TTPs, and MITRE known tactics.\\nIncident Correlation: Correlates security events and alerts across different sources to identify patterns and potential threats.\\n\\n\\nGet started with multi-layered detection and response today.\\nStep 3: View vulnerabilities in the same pane as your incidents \\nWhen vulnerabilities are isolated from incident data, the potential for delayed responses and oversight increases. This is because security teams end up lacking the context they need to understand how vulnerabilities are being exploited or the urgency of patching them in relation to ongoing incidents.\\nIn addition, when detection and response efforts leverage runtime monitoring (as explained above), vulnerability management becomes much more effective, focusing on active and critical risks to reduce noise by more than 90%.\\nHere are some key capabilities to leverage for this step:\\n\\nRisk Prioritization - Evaluates vulnerabilities according to critical criteria—such as whether they are loaded into the applications memory, are executed, public-facing, exploitable, or fixable—to focus on threats that actually matter.\\nRoot Cause Discovery - Finds the root cause for each vulnerability (in as deep as the image layer) in order to tackle the root as soon as possible and fix multiple vulnerabilities at once.\\nValidation of Fixes - Leverages ad-hoc scanning of images before they are deployed to ensure all vulnerabilities were addressed.\\nRegulation Adherence - Lists out all active vulnerabilities as an SBOM to adhere to compliance and regional regulations.\\n\\nStep 4: Incorporate identities to understand the \"who\", \"when\", and \"how\"\\nThreat actors often leverage compromised credentials to execute their attacks, engaging in credential theft, account takeovers, and more. This allows them to masquerade as legitimate users within the environment and go unnoticed for hours or even days. The key is to be able to detect this impersonation and the most effective way to do so is by establishing a baseline for each identity, human or otherwise. Once the typical access pattern of an identity is understood, detecting unusual behavior is easy. \\n\\nHere are some key capabilities to leverage for this step:\\n\\nBaseline Monitoring: Implements monitoring tools that capture and analyze baseline behavior for both users and applications. These tools should track access patterns, resource usage, and interaction with data.\\nHuman Identities Security: Integrates with identity providers for visibility into human identity usage, including login times, locations, devices, and behaviors, enabling quick detection of unusual or unauthorized access attempts.\\nNon-Human Identities Security: Tracks the usage of non-human identities, providing insights into their interactions with cloud resources and highlighting any anomalies that could signal a security threat.\\nSecrets Security: Identifies every secret across your cloud environment, tracks how it\\'s used at runtime, and highlights whether they\\'re securely managed or at risk of exposure.\\n\\nStep 5: Have a multitude of response actions available for contextual intervention\\nEach breach attempt has its own unique challenges to overcome, which is why it\\'s essential to have a flexible response strategy that adapts to the specific situation. For example, an attacker might deploy a malicious process that requires immediate termination, while a different cloud event might involve a compromised workload that needs to be quarantined to prevent further damage. Once an incident is detected, security teams also need the context in order to investigate fast, such as comprehensive attack stories, damage assessments, and response playbooks. \\nHere are some key capabilities to leverage for this step:\\n\\nPlaybooks: Provide play-by-play responses for every incident detected to confidently intervene and terminate the threat.\\nTailored Attack Intervention: Offers the ability to isolate compromised workloads, block unauthorized network traffic, or terminate malicious processes.\\nRoot Cause Analysis: Determines the underlying cause of the incident to prevent recurrence. This involves analyzing the attack vector, vulnerabilities exploited, and weaknesses in defenses.\\nIntegration with SIEM: Integrates with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to enhance threat detection with contextual data.\\n\\nBy implementing these five steps, security teams can boost their detection and response capabilities and effectively stop cloud breaches in real-time with complete precision. The time to act is now – Get started today with Sweet Security.', 'headline': '5 Steps to Boost Detection and Response in a Multi-Layered Cloud', 'summary': 'Traditional cloud security strategies focused on “shift-left” practices, but this has led to an over-reliance on DR tools and a lack of real-time visibility.

Alternatively, they can also serve to load plugins that augment a package\\'s features.\\n\\nCheckmarx noted that while entry points are a powerful way to improve modularity, the same feature could be abused to distribute malicious code to unsuspecting users. Some of the ways this could happen include command-jacking and creating rogue plugins for various tools and frameworks.\\nCommand-jacking occurs when counterfeit packages use entry points that impersonate popular third-party tools and commands (e.g., aws and docker), thereby harvesting sensitive information when developers install the package, even in cases where it\\'s distributed as a wheel (.whl) file.\\nSome of the widely-used third-party commands that could be potential targets for command-jacking comprise npm, pip, git, kubectl, terraform, gcloud, heroku, and dotnet. A second type command-jacking can also manifest when threat actors use legitimate system command names (e.g., touch, curl, cd, ls, and mkdir) as entry points in order to hijack the execution flow.\\n\"The success of this approach primarily depends on the PATH order,\" the researchers pointed out. \"If the directory containing the malicious entry points appears earlier in the PATH than the system directories, the malicious command will be executed instead of the system command. This is more likely to occur in development environments where local package directories are prioritized.\"\\nThat\\'s not all. Checkmarx found that the effectiveness of command-jacking can be improved by a more stealthy tactic called command wrapping, which involves creating an entry point that acts as a wrapper around the original command, instead of replacing it altogether.\\n\\nWhat makes the approach potent is that it silently executes the malicious code while also invoking the original, legitimate command and returning the results of the execution, thus allowing it to fly under the radar.\\n\"Since the legitimate command still runs and its output and behavior are preserved, there\\'s no immediate sign of compromise, making the attack extremely difficult to detect through normal use,\" the researchers said. \"This stealthy approach allows attackers to maintain long-term access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information without raising suspicion.\"\\nAnother entry point attack tactic entails creating malicious plugins and extensions for developer tools that have the capability to gain broad access to the codebase itself, thus giving bad actors an opportunity to change program behavior or tamper with the testing process to make it seem like the code is working as intended.\\n\\n\"Moving forward, it\\'s crucial to develop comprehensive security measures that account for entry point exploitation,\" the researchers said. \"By understanding and addressing these risks, we can work towards a more secure Python packaging environment, safeguarding both individual developers and enterprise systems against sophisticated supply chain attacks.\"\\nThe development comes as Sonatype, in its annual State of the Software Supply Chain report, revealed that over 512,847 malicious packages have been discovered across open-source ecosystems for Java, JavaScript, Python, and .NET since November 2023, a 156% jump year-over-year.\\n\"Traditional security tools often fail to detect these novel attacks, leaving developers and automated build environments highly vulnerable,\" the company said. \"This has resulted in a new wave of next-generation supply chain attacks, which target developers directly, bypassing existing defenses.\"', 'headline': 'Supply Chain Attacks Can Exploit Entry Points in Python, npm, and Open-Source Ecosystems', 'summary': 'Researchers discovered that entry points in various programming ecosystems, such as PyPI and npm, can be exploited for malicious code execution.

This concept is pivotal in networking and extends to other fields, such as radio and television, where signals are transmitted to all receivers within a certain range. In this article, we will explore the intricacies of broadcasting in computer networks, its types, advantages, and disadvantages, and how it compares with similar communication methods like multicasting.Understanding Broadcast in Computer NetworksIn computer networks, broadcast is a communication process that enables data transmission from one sender to all possible receivers within a network. Unlike unicast (one-to-one) or multicast (one-to-many), broadcasting ensures that every node in the network receives the message. This is particularly useful for sending information that needs to be universally acknowledged, such as network announcements or updates. The broadcasting mechanism involves setting a data packet’s destination address to a special broadcast address. For IPv4 networks, this address is typically 255.255.255.255, which signifies that the message should be delivered to all nodes on the local network.Examples of BroadcastBroadcast is commonly used in various networking protocols and scenarios:Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Requests: When a device needs to resolve an IP address to its corresponding MAC address, it sends an ARP request as a broadcast message. Every device on the network receives this request, but only the device with the matching IP address responds.Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Requests: When a device connects to a network and needs an IP address assignment, it broadcasts a DHCP request. The DHCP server responds with an appropriate IP configuration.Types of BroadcastTypes of BroadcastBroadcast can be categorized into three main types based on its scope and application:1. Limited BroadcastIn limited broadcasting, messages are sent to all nodes within the same local network. The broadcast does not extend beyond this local domain. The IPv4 broadcast address for this type is 255.255.255.255. This method is typically used for local network communications where global reach is unnecessary.2. Directed BroadcastDirected broadcasting involves sending messages to all nodes within a specific subnet rather than the entire local network. This is achieved by setting the host bits of the destination IPv4 address to 1 (e.g., 192.168.1.255). Directed broadcasts are useful when communication needs to be confined to specific segments of a more extensive network.3. Subnet BroadcastSubnet broadcasting targets specific subnets within a more extensive network architecture. Each subnet has its broadcast address, the highest possible address within that subnet’s range. For example, if a subnet has an address of 192.168.1.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, its broadcast address would be 192.168.1.255.Advantages of BroadcastBroadcasting offers several benefits that make it an essential tool in networking:Ease of CommunicationOne of broadcasting’s primary advantages is its simplicity. It delivers messages to all nodes without establishing individual connections with each one (point-to-point communication), reducing time and processing overhead significantly.Network TroubleshootingBroadcasting can help identify network issues or security threats by allowing administrators to send diagnostic messages across the entire network.Reduced Network TrafficWhile it may seem counterintuitive, broadcasting can reduce overall network traffic compared to unicast or multicast methods when universal message delivery is required. It eliminates the need for multiple individual transmissions.Disadvantages of BroadcastDespite its advantages, the broadcast also has several drawbacks:Broadcast StormsA broadcast storm occurs when too many devices simultaneously respond to a broadcast message by sending additional broadcasts. This can lead to excessive network traffic and potential network failure.Limited Control and Security IssuesBroadcasting lacks control over who receives the message since it is sent to all nodes indiscriminately. Sensitive information should not be broadcast without considering security implications.Scalability ConcernsBroadcasting does not scale well with large networks or when numerous devices are involved, as it can lead to congestion and inefficiencies.How Broadcast Works: A Step-by-Step ProcessUnderstanding how broadcasting functions at a technical level involves several key steps:Initiation: The sender sets the destination address as the broadcast address for the intended network.Encapsulation: The message is encapsulated into a network frame with its destination MAC Address set as the broadcast MAC Address.Transmission: The encapsulated message is transmitted across the network.Reception: All devices on the network receive this message and check if it matches their IP Address.Processing: Devices identifying as part of the intended recipients process the message; others discard it.Calculating Broadcast AddressesCalculating broadcast addresses involves understanding IP addressing and subnetting:Class A Example: For an IP address like 10.20.15.3 with a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0, perform bitwise OR operations on inverted subnet masks at each octet level to determine the broadcast address (e.g., 10.255.255.255).Class C Example: For an IP like 192.168.3.33 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.248, calculate using bitwise operations until reaching non-zero values in octets and apply additional steps for final octet calculations (e.g., resulting in 192.168.3.39).Comparison Between Broadcasting and MulticastingWhile both broadcasting and multicasting involve sending messages from one sender to multiple receivers, they differ fundamentally:ParameterBroadcastingMulticastingDefinitionMessage sent to all nodes in a networkAll devices in the networkNetwork OverheadHigh due to universal deliveryLower due to targeted deliveryAddressingUses broadcast addresses (e.g., IPv4: 192…10)Uses special multicast addressesRecipientsAll devices in networkMessage sent only to a specific group of nodesExampleARP requestsVideo streaming/meetings with specific clientsBroadcasting remains an integral part of networking due to its ability to efficiently disseminate information across entire networks without requiring complex infrastructure changes or configurations typical with unicast or multicast systems—despite potential security concerns associated with open-ended delivery methods like those seen today!

Cybersecurity means protecting a network, system, or application from cyberattacks by providing additional security measures.\\nCyber security tools are mainly used to prevent unauthorized access to data, cyberattacks, and identity thefts from occurring regularly. Cybersecurity risk management tools greatly enhance an organization’s ability to recognize, control, and mitigate cyber risks.\\n\\n\\nRisk management and data security strategies are crucial components of any strategy related to those topics. Modern businesses and organizations rely more on connected systems to operate, and this evolution is becoming increasingly complex in terms of security.\\nWhile the digital risk landscape keeps expanding and progressing, it is wise to recognize that you could face new cyber threats.\\nWhat Is Cybersecurity Risk Management?\\nCyber security risk management refers to a solution that prioritizes threats and mitigates them.\\nIn short, organizations and companies that implement this approach primarily use a cybersecurity risk management program to secure their IT networks and respond quickly to multiple critical threats.An effective cybersecurity risk management process involves various processes that interact with one another.However, to make it simpler, it’s divided into four key stages, and here below, we have mentioned those stages:-1. Identifying risk2. Assess risk3. Review controls4. Control risk\\nWhat Does A Cybersecurity Risk Management Tool Do?\\nIn order to manage uncertainty, risk management tools are an effective way of addressing several aspects of the issue, including:-1. Identification2. Generation3. Parameterization4. Prioritization5. Development of responses6. Monitoring of the riskThis means an organization’s ability to mitigate cyber threats effectively depends on these cybersecurity risk management tools.\\nWhat does it imply? It signifies that without these tools, it’s entirely impossible for mitigate such threats. These cybersecurity management tools deliver quantifiable techniques, strategies, and ready-to-use tactics to improve your organization’s cybersecurity vigilance.\\nWhy Is Cybersecurity Risk management Important?\\nA comprehensive cybersecurity management system is vital for decision-makers since it enables them to make accurate choices based on the information that they possess.\\nNot only that, but this approach also enables them to implement proper security measures.\\nThe first step that a business must take to determine if it is vulnerable to cyber-attacks is to conduct a cyber-risk assessment to assess the level of vulnerability that a business faces and the risks associated with cyber-attacks.\\nIn such cases, it is imperative to implement a proper cybersecurity management approach to ensure the network’s safety.\\nWhat Is A Security Risk Management Plan?\\nUsers can find and fix issues effectively with the security risk management strategic plan. And it also became easier to implement the best security measures with the help of monitored security results.SRMP (Strategic Security Risk Management Plan) is an essential foundation that outlines the issues pertinent to an organization’s security risk management. \\nStrategic Security Risk Management Plans help security companies reach a broader range of organizations.\\nHere Are Our Picks For The 10 Best Cybersecurity Risk Management Tools In 2024\\n\\nZenGRC is governance, risk management, and compliance software that simplifies managing business risks with automation.\\nCheckIt is a compliance and risk management tool that helps businesses monitor and comply with regulations effectively.\\nActive Risk Manager is a comprehensive tool designed to identify, manage, and mitigate risks across various business sectors.\\nEnablon: A platform for managing corporate sustainability, health, safety, and operational risk.\\nManageEngine Log360 is an integrated log management and security analytics solution that helps monitor and mitigate network threats.\\nPathlock is a security platform that controls access to critical applications and data across multiple environments.\\nIsometrix is a versatile tool designed for integrated risk management, especially useful in sectors requiring strict compliance controls.\\nRisk Management Studio is software that provides solutions for risk assessment and data protection management and is particularly useful in aligning with ISO standards.\\nCURA Enterprise Risk Management is a dynamic solution that helps organizations manage a wide spectrum of risks, including strategic, operational, and financial.\\nResolver Risk Management Software: This tool focuses on risk assessment, incident management, and investigation, helping businesses to understand and manage risks effectively.\\n\\nCybersecurity Risk Management Tools Features\\nCybersecurity Risk Management ToolsKey FeaturesStand Alone FeaturePricingFree trial/ Demo1.

One image, which does not contain a vehicle or a license plate, shows a bright red “Trump” campaign sign placed in front of someone’s garage. In the background is a banner referencing Israel, a holly wreath, and a festive inflatable snowman.Another image taken on a different day by a different vehicle shows a “Steelworkers for Harris-Walz” sign stuck in the lawn in front of someone’s home. A construction worker, with his face unblurred, is pictured near another Harris sign. Other photos show Trump and Biden (including “Fuck Biden”) bumper stickers on the back of trucks and cars across America. One photo, taken in November 2023, shows a partially torn bumper sticker supporting the Obama-Biden lineup.These images were generated by AI-powered cameras mounted on cars and trucks, initially designed to capture license plates, but which are now photographing political lawn signs outside private homes, individuals wearing T-shirts with text, and vehicles displaying pro-abortion bumper stickers—all while recording the precise locations of these observations. Newly obtained data reviewed by WIRED shows how a tool originally intended for traffic enforcement has evolved into a system capable of monitoring speech protected by the US Constitution.The detailed photographs all surfaced in search results produced by the systems of DRN Data, a license-plate-recognition (LPR) company owned by Motorola Solutions. The LPR system can be used by private investigators, repossession agents, and insurance companies; a related Motorola business, called Vigilant, gives cops access to the same LPR data.However, files shared with WIRED by artist Julia Weist, who is documenting restricted datasets as part of her work, show how those with access to the LPR system can search for common phrases or names, such as those of politicians, and be served with photographs where the search term is present, even if it is not displayed on license plates.A search result for the license plates from Delaware vehicles with the text “Trump” returned more than 150 images showing people’s homes and bumper stickers. Each search result includes the date, time, and exact location of where a photograph was taken.“I searched for the word ‘believe,’ and that is all lawn signs. There’s things just painted on planters on the side of the road, and then someone wearing a sweatshirt that says ‘Believe.’” Weist says. “I did a search for the word ‘lost,’ and it found the flyers that people put up for lost dogs and cats.”Beyond highlighting the far-reaching nature of LPR technology, which has collected billions of images of license plates, the research also shows how people’s personal political views and their homes can be recorded into vast databases that can be queried.“It really reveals the extent to which surveillance is happening on a mass scale in the quiet streets of America,” says Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. “That surveillance is not limited just to license plates, but also to a lot of other potentially very revealing information about people.”DRN, in a statement issued to WIRED, said it complies with “all applicable laws and regulations.”Billions of PhotosLicense-plate-recognition systems, broadly, work by first capturing an image of a vehicle; then they use optical character recognition (OCR) technology to identify and extract the text from the vehicle's license plate within the captured image. Motorola-owned DRN sells multiple license-plate-recognition cameras: a fixed camera that can be placed near roads, identify a vehicle’s make and model, and capture images of vehicles traveling up to 150 mph; a “quick deploy” camera that can be attached to buildings and monitor vehicles at properties; and mobile cameras that can be placed on dashboards or be mounted to vehicles and capture images when they are driven around.Over more than a decade, DRN has amassed more than 15 billion “vehicle sightings” across the United States, and it claims in its marketing materials that it amasses more than 250 million sightings per month. Images in DRN’s commercial database are shared with police using its Vigilant system, but images captured by law enforcement are not shared back into the wider database.The system is partly fueled by DRN “affiliates” who install cameras in their vehicles, such as repossession trucks, and capture license plates as they drive around. Each vehicle can have up to four cameras attached to it, capturing images in all angles. These affiliates earn monthly bonuses and can also receive free cameras and search credits.In 2022, Weist became a certified private investigator in New York State. In doing so, she unlocked the ability to access the vast array of surveillance software accessible to PIs. Weist could access DRN’s analytics system, DRNsights, as part of a package through investigations company IRBsearch. (After Weist published an op-ed detailing her work, IRBsearch conducted an audit of her account and discontinued it. The company did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.)“There is a difference between tools that are publicly accessible, like Google Street View, and things that are searchable,” Weist says. While conducting her work, Weist ran multiple searches for words and popular terms, which found results far beyond license plates. In data she shared with WIRED, a search for “Planned Parenthood,” for instance, returned stickers on cars, on bumpers, and in windows, both for and against the reproductive health services organization. Civil liberties groups have already raised concerns about how license-plate-reader data could be weaponized against those seeking abortion.Weist says she is concerned with how the search tools could be misused when there is increasing political violence and divisiveness in society. While not linked to license plate data, one law enforcement official in Ohio recently said people should “write down” the addresses of people who display yard signs supporting Vice President Kamala Harris, the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, exemplifying how a searchable database of citizens’ political affiliations could be abused.A 2016 report by the Associated Press revealed widespread misuse of confidential law enforcement databases by police officers nationwide. In 2022, WIRED revealed that hundreds of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees and contractors were investigated for abusing similar databases, including LPR systems. The alleged misconduct in both reports ranged from stalking and harassment to sharing information with criminals.While people place signs in their lawns or bumper stickers on their cars to inform people of their views and potentially to influence those around them, the ACLU’s Stanley says it is intended for “human-scale visibility,” not that of machines. “Perhaps they want to express themselves in their communities, to their neighbors, but they don't necessarily want to be logged into a nationwide database that’s accessible to police authorities,” Stanley says.Weist says the system, at the very least, should be able to filter out images that do not contain license plate data and not make mistakes. “Any number of times is too many times, especially when it's finding stuff like what people are wearing or lawn signs,” Weist says.“License plate recognition (LPR) technology supports public safety and community services, from helping to find abducted children and stolen vehicles to automating toll collection and lowering insurance premiums by mitigating insurance fraud,” Jeremiah Wheeler, the president of DRN, says in a statement.Weist believes that, given the relatively small number of images showing bumper stickers compared to the large number of vehicles with them, Motorola Solutions may be attempting to filter out images containing bumper stickers or other text.Wheeler did not respond to WIRED's questions about whether there are limits on what can be searched in license plate databases, why images of homes with lawn signs but no vehicles in sight appeared in search results, or if filters are used to reduce such images.“DRNsights complies with all applicable laws and regulations,” Wheeler says. “The DRNsights tool allows authorized parties to access license plate information and associated vehicle information that is captured in public locations and visible to all. Access is restricted to customers with certain permissible purposes under the law, and those in breach have their access revoked.”AI EverywhereLicense-plate-recognition systems have flourished in recent years as cameras have become smaller and machine-learning algorithms have improved. These systems, such as DRN and rival Flock, mark part of a change in the way people are surveilled as they move around cities and neighborhoods.Increasingly, CCTV cameras are being equipped with AI to monitor people’s movements and even detect their emotions. The systems have the potential to alert officials, who may not be able to constantly monitor CCTV footage, to real-world events. However, whether license plate recognition can reduce crime has been questioned.“When government or private companies promote license plate readers, they make it sound like the technology is only looking for lawbreakers or people suspected of stealing a car or involved in an amber alert, but that’s just not how the technology works,” says Dave Maass, the director of investigations at civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “The technology collects everyone's data and stores that data often for immense periods of time.”Over time, the technology may become more capable, too. Maass, who has long researched license-plate-recognition systems, says companies are now trying to do “vehicle fingerprinting,” where they determine the make, model, and year of the vehicle based on its shape and also determine if there’s damage to the vehicle. DRN’s product pages say one upcoming update will allow insurance companies to see if a car is being used for ride-sharing.“The way that the country is set up was to protect citizens from government overreach, but there’s not a lot put in place to protect us from private actors who are engaged in business meant to make money,” Nicole McConlogue, an associate professor of law at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law, who has researched license-plate-surveillance systems and their potential for discrimination.“The volume that they’re able to do this in is what makes it really troubling,” McConlogue says of vehicles moving around streets collecting images. “When you do that, you're carrying the incentives of the people that are collecting the data. But also, in the United States, you’re carrying with it the legacy of segregation and redlining, because that left a mark on the composition of neighborhoods.”\", 'headline': 'License Plate Readers Are Creating a US-Wide Database of More Than Just Cars', 'summary': 'License plate readers are now capturing images of political lawn signs, individuals wearing text-based clothing, and vehicles displaying pro-abortion bumper stickers, raising concerns about potential misuse of this technology for surveillance.

ICE and Paragon did not immediately respond to WIRED’s requests for comment.This is not Paragon’s first government agency contract. The New York Times reported in December 2022 that the US Drug Enforcement Administration had used Graphite. Similarly, an intelligence publication reported in March 2023 that Paragon had landed a major contract in Singapore worth “tens of millions of dollars.”Paragon’s contract comes amid a comprehensive effort by the US government to reshape the commercial spyware market over the past three years. Measures have included placing spyware vendors like NSO Group and Intellexa on the so-called Entity List to prevent any US companies from doing business with them; enacting a visa restriction policy against multiple individuals “who have been involved in the development and sale of commercial spyware or who are immediate family members of those involved,” and imposing consecutive rounds of sanctions against spyware vendors.Many of these efforts followed President Joe Biden signing an executive order in March 2023 that effectively restricted the US government’s use of commercial spyware technology while promoting its “responsible use” that aligns with the protection of human rights.On a global level, the US is leading an initiative stipulated in the “Joint Statement on Efforts to Counter the Proliferation and Misuse of Commercial Spyware,” which now counts 21 signatories, including Germany, France, UK, Japan, and South Korea, while it recently announced that it would fund governments and civil society groups around the world to develop spyware-related research and regulation.Paragon, which characterizes itself as a scrupulous kind of spyware maker, is likely responding to the US government’s global push for responsible surveillance. On the website of its US subsidiary, the company boasts that it provides its customers with “ethically based tools,” while one of its investors maintains that the company’s software provides “cutting-edge capabilities that make the world safer.”Elsewhere, Paragon states that it limits its extraction of information from targeted devices “to conversations on chat apps” and that it “works solely with police forces and intelligence agencies that meet the standards of an enlightened democracy, which includes only 39 countries.”Paragon was founded in 2019 by veterans from the Israel Defense Forces’ powerful intelligence Unit 8200 with the active involvement of former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak as an investor who is estimated to own a sizable slice of the company.The company has received investment from the Boston-headquartered Battery Ventures, “considered to be one of the world’s top venture capital firms,” and two of its founders formerly worked for Blumberg Capital, another large US venture capital firm.Israeli media reported in June that a US private equity fund with a portfolio of security companies has been in talks to acquire control of Paragon, estimating its valuation at $1 billion.To secure its unique US-approved, “ethical” positioning, Paragon has made “deliberate efforts” since its establishment to break into the US market, notes the Atlantic Council.In 2019, as Paragon was developing Graphite, the company enlisted WestExec Advisors, a prominent Washington, DC, consulting firm cofounded by former Obama administration officials, including current US secretary of state Antony Blinken, to advise on its “strategic approach to the US and European markets,” a company executive told the Financial Times. Avril Haines, a former WestExec staffer, is now the US director of national intelligence.To remain in the US government’s “good graces,” Paragon in February 2023 hired another DC-based lobbying firm, Holland & Knight, “with a good track record in avoiding sanctions,” as some reports point out. Lobbying expenditure disclosure reveals a spend of a minimum $280,000 in 2023 and 2024 for this campaign.The fact that the spyware vendor has neither been placed on an entity list nor have any of its executives been sanctioned by the Biden administration suggests that Paragon’s lobbying efforts have been successful.In addition, Biden’s executive order leaves enough margin for the deployment of tools like Graphite. When a senior US administration official was asked specifically about potential abuses of Paragon’s flagship product, they said that the executive order “requires the heads of agencies to review any activity that might be relevant,” without excluding the possibility of lawful use.Meanwhile, the company continues to grow and is advertising several roles in Israel. In the US, Paragon boosted its presence in the wake of the signing of the executive order and started hiring intelligence veterans, including former CIA and FBI officers at its subsidiary, “hoping it would pick up new business.” Fresh reports from February 2024 confirmed the steady growth.Paragon’s $2 million contract with ICE is tangible proof that the company’s approach is paying off. It remains to be seen whether Graphite's deployment will align with the protection of human rights, privacy, and democracy.\", 'headline': 'ICE Signs $2 Million Contract With Spyware Maker Paragon Solutions', 'summary': \"US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has awarded a $2 million contract to Paragon Solutions, an Israeli spyware vendor, despite the Biden administration's efforts to restrict the use of such technology.

For the first time, Apple is taking your phone’s ability to save login details and putting them in a standalone app. It could help improve millions of people’s terrible passwords.After years of being told you should create unique, strong passwords for every website and app you use, you probably fall into one of two camps: people that are fully signed up to the password manager life, or those still using “123456” for every other website.The new Passwords app in iOS 18.\\nPhotograph: WIRED StaffApple’s new encrypted Passwords app is automatically included with iOS 18, and is a public-facing evolution of its Keychain and password-saving capabilities. The Keychain, which has existed for more than a decade, no longer has as prominent a home in the iPhone’s settings, and details previously saved there are being moved to the new app.The launch of the password manager app, which will also be available on macOS Sequoia and iPadOS 18, may help improve people’s relationships with their passwords but also could, to varying degrees, challenge existing password managers.“This move makes the app more visible to lay users and informs them about this secure method to store and manage passwords,” says Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk from security company Mysk. “You have a default password manager preinstalled on your device [that] provides end-to-end encryption when syncing data across devices.”New PasswordsThe Passwords app has a pretty barebones design. Six different tiles are presented when you open the app on an iPhone: All, Passkeys, Codes, Wi-Fi, Security, and Deleted. These are essentially the main functions of the app, allowing you to save each type of data within their relevant sections. The security section includes check-ups allowing weak and exposed passwords to be identified.“This will definitely boost the adoption of this preinstalled app and bolster user security,” Bakry and Mysk say. They add that it presents the saved data “in a more organized way than the Settings app.”Apple says the Passwords app uses end-to-end encryption to save your details, meaning nobody, not even Apple, knows what you have saved. Within the app, you can search for login details to your entries and set up groups to share passwords with other people.Your saved login details are synced across Apple devices using iCloud, meaning the encrypted data is shared with Apple’s cloud servers and available on all of your Apple devices. Within Apple’s settings, you can turn off syncing passwords on a specific device. The app is locked using Face ID.When using the Passwords app, any details you have previously saved in Keychain or AutoFill will be moved to the new location. This includes if you have used the Sign in with Apple login system on any websites or apps. It is unclear why Apple has decided to spin its Keychain system into a fully fledged password manager now, although the company has been building out the individual features over a number of years. (Apple has not responded to WIRED’s request for comment at the time of writing.)For many people, having a standalone password manager app from Apple could encourage better password practices. Siamak Shahandashti, a senior lecturer in the University of York’s cybersecurity and privacy research group, says the move from Apple may be a usability decision. Making Passwords visible could encourage people to take their passwords seriously.“We need to design authentication systems for human beings,” Shahandashti says. “We cannot expect users to maintain a hundred accounts, for each of them [to] use a strong password. It’s actually the fault of the designers because these systems have not been designed for users considering the capability of an average human being.”Death of the PasswordPasswords are slowly dying. Enter the passkey. For the past couple of years, websites, apps, and phone manufacturers have been in the process of rolling out passkeys—a technology that replaces passwords, is more secure, and doesn’t require you to remember any complex login details. (Although passkeys still have some teething problems.)Leona Lassak, a research assistant at Ruhr-University Bochum who has studied passkey adoption, says greater “visibility” of the Passwords app can help get the sign-in technology to a broader audience, one which might not use a password manager otherwise. Apple’s Passwords app could help with the perception and transition to passkeys, Lassak says. “There has been discussion about the need for passkey managers, because once we actually use them on websites, there's probably going to be multiple for each website,” she says.The app is also, at least subtly, encouraging the adoption of passkeys. Within Passwords’ settings, accessed through Apple’s System preferences, there’s the option to turn on “automatic” passkey upgrades, which will allow existing accounts to use passkeys when they are available.Lock InPassword managers have existed for years and there are plenty of options you can use, from open source apps to browser-based management systems. Each comes with their own particular set of pros and cons.Apple wading into the password management market by including a new app on millions of iPhones, Macs, and iPads could also impact the wider ecosystem. “There’s no question that Apple’s Passwords app would ‘sherlock’ third-party password managers—or make them less attractive,” say Bakry and Mysk, highlighting that people need to use iCloud to sync passwords in Apple’s system, and that those who are privacy conscious may not want this to happen automatically.There’s also the risk of locking people into Apple’s password manager—at launch, there appear to be no options to export the saved data and use it in a commercial alternative. One competitor password manager has stressed that their software works on products “beyond” the “Apple ecosystem.” (People using Apple’s password management software on Windows devices can access saved details through iCloud for Windows.)Ultimately, what password manager you use should reflect what type of software you want to support and the individual threats you may face. For many, Apple’s new app is probably better than not using a password manager at all.\", 'headline': 'Apple’s New Passwords App May Solve Your Login Nightmares', 'summary': \"Apple has launched a new standalone password manager app in iOS 18.

There are a lot of moving parts to it, but I think they've done pretty well.”And so far, there’s nothing else quite like it. “Hybrid AI” used on Samsung Galaxy devices running Google Android and Google’s Nano range sees some AI processes handled locally, leveraging cloud when necessary to enable more advanced capabilities.The idea is to provide as much privacy as possible while offering powerful AI functionality, says Camden Woollven, group head of AI at GRC International Group, an IT governance firm. “This means you could potentially see some pretty sophisticated AI, even on midrange smartphones.”But this type of hybrid AI processing still may pose risks because some data is sent to cloud servers without the levels of accountability that Apple offers with its PCC. “With hybrid AI, some data must leave the device and be processed elsewhere, making it more susceptible to interception or misuse,” says Riccardo Ocleppo, founder and director of Open Institute of Technology, which provides technology-focused courses.Yet Google and its hardware partners argue privacy and security are a major focus of the Android AI approach. VP Justin Choi, head of the security team, mobile eXperience business at\\nSamsung\\nElectronics, says its hybrid AI offers users “control over their data and uncompromising privacy.”Choi describes how features processed in the cloud\\nare protected by servers governed by strict policies. “Our on-device AI features provide another element of security by performing tasks locally on the device with no reliance on cloud servers, neither storing data on the device nor uploading it to the cloud,” Choi says.Google says its data centers are designed with robust security measures, including physical security, access controls, and data encryption. When processing AI requests in the cloud, the company says, data stays within secure Google data center architecture and the firm is not sending your information to third parties.Meanwhile, Galaxy’s AI engines are not trained with user data from on-device features, says Choi. Samsung “clearly indicates” which AI functions run on the device with its Galaxy AI symbol, and the smartphone maker adds a watermark to show when content has used generative AI.The firm has also introduced a new security and privacy option called\\nAdvanced Intelligence settings\\nto give users the choice to disable cloud-based AI capabilities.Google says it “has a long history of protecting user data privacy,” adding that this applies to its AI features powered on-device and in the cloud. “We utilize on-device models, where data never leaves the phone, for sensitive cases such as screening phone calls,” Suzanne Frey, vice president of product trust at Google, tells WIRED.Frey describes how Google products rely on its cloud-based models, which she says ensures “consumer's information, like sensitive information that you want to summarize, is never sent to a third party for processing.”“We’ve remained committed to building AI-powered features that people can trust because they are secure by default and private by design, and most importantly, follow Google’s responsible AI principles that were first to be championed in the industry,” Frey says.Apple Changes the ConversationRather than simply matching the “hybrid” approach to data processing, experts say Apple’s AI strategy has changed the nature of the conversation. “Everyone expected this on-device, privacy-first push, but what Apple actually did was say, it doesn’t matter what you do in AI—or where—it’s how you do it,” Doffman says. He thinks this “will likely define best practice across the smartphone AI space.”Even so, Apple hasn’t won the AI privacy battle just yet: The deal with OpenAI—which sees Apple uncharacteristically opening up its iOS ecosystem to an outside vendor—could put a dent in its privacy claims.Apple refutes Musk’s claims that the OpenAI partnership compromises iPhone security, with “privacy protections built in for users who access ChatGPT.” The company says you will be asked permission before your query is shared with ChatGPT, while IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI will not store requests—but ChatGPT’s data use policies still apply.Partnering with another company is a “strange move” for Apple, but the decision “would not have been taken lightly,” says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security firm ESET. While the exact privacy implications are not yet clear, he concedes that “some personal data may be collected on both sides and potentially analyzed by OpenAI.”This means for some data, “you're stuck with OpenAI's rules,” says Schneier. “Apple strips identifying information when sending OpenAI the queries, but there's a lot of identifying information in many queries.”The collaboration between Apple and OpenAI has the potential to “totally reshape accountability across the AI landscape,” says Andy Pardoe, a professor of artificial intelligence and founder of tech consultancy Wisdom Works Group. “Partnerships like this distribute liability across multiple different entities, impacting how responsibility is assigned for the successes and potential failures within their interconnected systems.”There are also security risks to be considered as AI technology is integrated into tech giants’ operating systems. While Apple Intelligence is an impressive feat in theory at least, the firm’s AI tools also create “a huge attack surface that's never before seen the light of day,” Doffman says. “It takes a raft of different security innovations and combines them in a new offering for a new purpose, so if it works, it's a game changer. But there will be issues when it goes live that Apple will need to manage.”It is for this reason that Apple and Google are encouraging security researchers to find holes in their AI solutions. Google’s Secure AI Framework sees security outfit Mandiant test the defenses of AI models.An Apple spokesperson provided links to its PCC security paper and the model paper detailing its “responsible” approach to AI development. Apple did not have an on-the-record response to WIRED’s follow-up questions regarding privacy concerns related to its OpenAI partnership or potential security risks.Apple is using a model it calls “verifiable transparency” for PCC. “We want to ensure that security and privacy researchers can inspect Private Cloud Compute software, verify its functionality and help identify issues—just like they can with Apple devices,” Apple said in a blog post introducing PCC. To allow this, Apple is making software images of\\nevery production build of PCC publicly available for security researchers.Apple Intelligence will be integrated into its soon-to-launch iOS 18 software update alongside ChatGPT, with the full suite of features coming to the iPhone 16 this fall. You will be able to switch it off, but if you want to use AI features on any device, it is wise to consider the privacy and security implications.When choosing between iOS and Android AI specifically, it comes down to who you trust. Pardoe recommends evaluating the operating systems’ overall trade-offs in terms of privacy features, data-handling practices, and transparency. That said, as Pardoe points out, “Apple's strong privacy focus remains a key highlight for users who prioritize data security above all else.”\", 'headline': 'How Apple Intelligence’s Privacy Stacks Up Against Android’s ‘Hybrid AI’', 'summary': \"Apple's new AI architecture, called Apple Intelligence, uses a private cloud system called Private Cloud Compute (PCC) to protect user privacy, while Android's hybrid AI approach uses a combination of on-device and cloud-based processing.

It gets installed by exploiting more than 20,000 common misconfigurations, a capability that may make millions of machines connected to the internet potential targets, researchers from Aqua Security said. It can also exploit CVE-2023-33426, a vulnerability with a severity rating of 10 out of 10 that was patched last year in Apache RocketMQ, a messaging and streaming platform that’s found on many Linux machines.Perfctl StormThe researchers are calling the malware Perfctl, the name of a malicious component that surreptitiously mines cryptocurrency. The unknown developers of the malware gave the process a name that combines the perf Linux monitoring tool and ctl, an abbreviation commonly used with command line tools. A signature characteristic of Perfctl is its use of process and file names that are identical or similar to those commonly found in Linux environments. The naming convention is one of the many ways the malware attempts to escape notice of infected users.Perfctl further cloaks itself using a host of other tricks. One is that it installs many of its components as rootkits, a special class of malware that hides its presence from the operating system and administrative tools. Other stealth mechanisms include:Stopping activities that are easy to detect when a new user logs inUsing a Unix socket over TOR for external communicationsDeleting its installation binary after execution and running as a background service thereafterManipulating the Linux process pcap_loop through a technique known as hooking to prevent admin tools from recording the malicious trafficSuppressing mesg errors to avoid any visible warnings during execution.The malware is designed to ensure persistence, meaning the ability to remain on the infected machine after reboots or attempts to delete core components. Two such techniques are (1) modifying the ~/.profile script, which sets up the environment during user login so the malware loads ahead of legitimate workloads expected to run on the server and (2) copying itself from memory to multiple disk locations. The hooking of pcap_loop can also provide persistence by allowing malicious activities to continue even after primary payloads are detected and removed.Besides using the machine resources to mine cryptocurrency, Perfctl also turns the machine into a profit-making proxy that paying customers use to relay their internet traffic. Aqua Security researchers have also observed the malware serving as a backdoor to install other families of malware.Assaf Morag, Aqua Security’s threat intelligence director, wrote in an email:Perfctl malware stands out as a significant threat due to its design, which enables it to evade detection while maintaining persistence on infected systems. This combination poses a challenge for defenders and indeed the malware has been linked to a growing number of reports and discussions across various forums, highlighting the distress and frustration of users who find themselves infected.Perfctl uses a rootkit and changes some of the system utilities to hide the activity of the cryptominer and proxy-jacking software. It blends seamlessly into its environment with seemingly legitimate names. Additionally, Perfctl’s architecture enables it to perform a range of malicious activities, from data exfiltration to the deployment of additional payloads. Its versatility means that it can be leveraged for various malicious purposes, making it particularly dangerous for organizations and individuals alike.“The Malware Always Manages to Restart”While Perfctl and some of the malware it installs are detected by some antivirus software, Aqua Security researchers were unable to find any research reports on the malware. They were, however, able to find a wealth of threads on developer-related sites that discussed infections consistent with it.This Reddit comment posted to the CentOS subreddit is typical. An admin noticed that two servers were infected with a cryptocurrency hijacker with the names perfcc and perfctl. The admin wanted help investigating the cause.“I only became aware of the malware because my monitoring setup alerted me to 100% CPU utilization,” the admin wrote in the April 2023 post. “However, the process would stop immediately when I logged in via SSH or console. As soon as I logged out, the malware would resume running within a few seconds or minutes.” The admin continued:I have attempted to remove the malware by following the steps outlined in other forums, but to no avail. The malware always manages to restart once I log out.
